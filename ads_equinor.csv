They really should try to keep up.

On the same day Labour took to BBC Question Time to, once again, talk down Teesside, I visited the huge SeAH Wind Turbine Monopile Factory, set to open by next year along with Ben Houchen - Tees Valley Mayor .

It's an engineering marvel, towering at 40 metres and stretching 900 metres - as large as four Riverside Stadiums side by side. 

It's literally going to bring thousands of great jobs to our region.  So I'm afraid Labour are, at best, horribly uninformed, and at worst?  Deliberately misleading. 🥀

Alongside Ben Houchen, I've witnessed first-hand the strides we're making, from the New South Bank Quay to future carbon capture initiatives with BP, Equinor, and Total. 

Teesside's revival hinges on the success of projects like Teesworks. 

It's exhilarating to see such innovation taking root in our backyard.

Like what we share? Spread it around, new audiences will help spread the word on political events ongoing.
-
“BP has reported its biggest quarterly profit for 14 years after oil and gas prices soared. The energy giant saw underlying profits hit $8.45bn (£6.9bn) between April and June - more than triple the amount it made in the same period last year.

The bumper profits have prompted calls for the government to tax firms further to help families with rising bills.

BP's profits were the second highest for the second quarter in the firm's history.
It follows a host of profit announcements from other firms including Shell, Equinor, TotalEnergies and British Gas owner Centrica, which have been reaping the benefits of higher gas and oil prices.

Dale Vince, the founder of energy supplier Ecotricity said BP was ""holding a shedload of money that is coming from hard-pressed bill-payers in our country"", adding he believed it was time to increase taxation on the profits of oil and gas companies.”

Information on a multi-million pound proposed scheme for The Humber for producing and distributing power in a cleaner and greener way, has been brought to the attention of Ward Members over recent weeks. We have attended a number of briefings and Q&A sessions and are impressed by what we have heard. However, the proposals are in their early stages and many questions will need answers before matters are finalised.

You can click on the link below to have a look at the publicity which is just released explaining what are the long-term benefits to Saltend, to South West Holderness residents and to the wider region of the Humber.

It is apparently the case that the industry in our area produces more polluting CO2 emissions than anywhere else in the UK and it is a situation that needs to be seriously addressed. 

The company, Equinor, which is at the forefront of the H2H proposals, scheme is backed by a consortium of 12 or more major power stations and manufacturers right around the Humber. They have proposals to both collect CO2  by pipeline, store this gas in the North Sea caverns and to vastly increase Green and Blue Hydrogen production at Saltend to be used by manufacturers right across the Humber etc. Many are keen to be involved in this Hydrogen power and are looking into adapting their equipment. Existing Saltend based companies, including Triton Power, are already expressing interest.

These Hydrogens are carbon-friendly fuel sources that will eventually be available across the region, both North and South of the Humber.  Already Ineos is producing Hydrogen locally and Equinor is to seek planning and other permissions to create another plant within the Saltend Chemical Park. They accept that they will have to comply with the strict ‘Control of Major Accident Hazards (COMAH) safety rules which affect all Saltend companies, under the HSE. They are however keen to locate their operations there as the visual impacts will be lessened. This plant will produce Hydrogen but using cleaner and greener methods.

Many power plants and manufacturers will be able to access the supply by way of a new cross-Humber pipeline network and as we currently understand it the long-term impact is that our region will see much of its pollution reduced and will gain many ‘green’ benefits.

It is explained much more fully in the following link -

https://engage.erm.com/equinor-h2h-saltend

The Humber region, together with The Tees around Middlesbrough, forms the massive East Coast Cluster and is set to create a vital hub of carbon-friendly production, much larger and more important than any other region of the UK, coupled with massive Carbon Capture technology and storage 

Local businesses on both sides of the river are embracing the opportunities it will bring and we residents should carefully consider the impacts of the scheme, how employment could be increased over the decades to come and the benefits to our environment.  Please ask the developers any questions which they assure us they are keen to address.

All in all, we are presented with ideas that could result in a very exciting future for residents and generations to come.
In future years, The Humber is set to become a major contributor to the nation’s wealth.

As Ward Members of course, whilst supporting the concept, we will have many questions which will need answering before we are able to give the scheme our full backing, eg, flooding, emissions, HGVs and general commuting traffic, but on the information provided, there appear to be major benefits to the whole East Coast Cluster. It is a very exciting prospect but we aren’t being swept along on a PR wave.

As innovators and problem solvers, engineers are central to solving this problem and we’ll be speaking to difference makers across the world about the incredible work they are doing to engineer a better world!","The 150 Show – The Green Edition","The 150 Show – The Green Edition","We believe engineers have the skills, insights and ingenuity to help tackle climate change and find sustainable solutions to the world’s issues. During this programme we explore the innovative ways that engineers and society are helping to solve these global issues. From climate change and sustainable fashion, to packet-less food and electric motorsport.  

We’ll also be talking to IET Council member, Faye Banks, on electrical engineering and how her leadership role in Siemens UK is contributing towards sustainable energy. Ivan Ling, a winner of the IET Global Challenge Award in 2019, will be giving a glimpse into the future of dissolvable food packaging, and we’ll find out what Singapore is doing to earn the title of the world’s greenest city. 

As in all episodes of The 150 Show, we’ll also be joined the Youth STEM Personality of the Year winner - Callum Daniel who will be entertaining us with experiments that you can do at home, creator of #bakineering and Great British Bake Off finalist - Andrew Smyth who will be getting creative in the kitchen, IET Honorary Fellows, experts and more. All presented by our President, Danielle George. 

Don’t worry if you can’t join us live – each show will be available afterwards on demand, just follow the link at the top of the page.

Tune into The 150 Show as we explore the innovative ways that engineers and society are helping to solve these global issues.","The 150 Show – The Green Edition","The 150 Show – The Green Edition","We believe engineers have the skills, insights and ingenuity to help tackle climate change and find sustainable solutions to the world’s issues. During this programme we explore the innovative ways that engineers and society are helping to solve these global issues. From climate change and sustainable fashion, to packet-less food and electric motorsport.  

We’ll also be talking to IET Council member, Faye Banks, on electrical engineering and how her leadership role in Siemens UK is contributing towards sustainable energy. Ivan Ling, a winner of the IET Global Challenge Award in 2019, will be giving a glimpse into the future of dissolvable food packaging, and we’ll find out what Singapore is doing to earn the title of the world’s greenest city. 

As in all episodes of The 150 Show, we’ll also be joined the Youth STEM Personality of the Year winner - Callum Daniel who will be entertaining us with experiments that you can do at home, creator of #bakineering and Great British Bake Off finalist - Andrew Smyth who will be getting creative in the kitchen, IET Honorary Fellows, experts and more. All presented by our President, Danielle George. 

Don’t worry if you can’t join us live – each show will be available afterwards on demand, just follow the link at the top of the page.
