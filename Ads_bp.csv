Today the High Court agreed the new road can go ahead after legal challenges. As a former resident of Mottram and of Hollingworth, and former @[100068995636623:2048:Longdendale] councillor, I have spent 20 years fighting to get this much needed road built (as some of the pictures of a younger me demonstrate!).

This infrastructure will boost local health outcomes and quality of life, as well as the regional economy. It's been a long time coming but the end is finally in sight! 

Many of you are familiar with the history of this essential project, which is that the Department of Transport initially sent inspectors to Hyde in 1965 (!) to begin this process. The original M67 would have incorporated the bypass and
 connected Manchester city centre with Sheffield.

For my own part, as someone who first attended a resident’s meeting on this issue in 2003, it is brilliant news. My old ward colleague, the late Cllr. Roy Oldham, would also be delighted. I would also like to pay tribute to the great many local residents who have campaigned for this for so long, and to thank my neighbouring MPs and local councillors. On the Derbyshire side, cross-border and cross-party working over many years has been key. I’d particularly like to thank both the current MP for High Peak, Robert Largan, and the prospective Labour candidate, @[100086641869176:2048:Jon Pearce], for their support and work.  
 
Highways England, who I last met with a week ago, will now update and publish the key information on the scheme. The construction compound will be built near the BP Garage on Hyde Road. Construction will take 2.5-3 years. A small number of families who currently rent properties from Highways England will have to move, but I have spoken to the authorities about this to make sure they are supported. There will be disruption for a project of this scale, but as ever I will continue to make sure people are fully informed of what is happening. 
 
Finally, there is of course still the need to ensure Hollingworth and Glossop also receive a solution to our traffic problems. The Department of Transport has done many studies over the last few years into the wider Manchester-Sheffield transport corridor, and now we have got through this hurdle I will be seeking to meet them alongside my neighbouring colleagues to address this.",,,,"lower_bound: 5000, upper_bound: 5999","lower_bound: 0, upper_bound: 99",GBP,"{""age"":""18-24"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.006508},{""age"":""65+"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.175705},{""age"":""45-54"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.004338},{""age"":""25-34"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.002169},{""age"":""25-34"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.030369},{""age"":""45-54"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.104121},{""age"":""35-44"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.067245},{""age"":""45-54"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.086768},{""age"":""65+"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.088937},{""age"":""65+"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.010846},{""age"":""55-64"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.10846},{""age"":""55-64"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.167028},{""age"":""35-44"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.058568},{""age"":""25-34"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.069414},{""age"":""55-64"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.006508},{""age"":""18-24"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.010846},{""age"":""18-24"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.002169}","{""region"":""Scotland"",""percentage"":0.002141},{""region"":""England"",""percentage"":0.989293},{""region"":""Wales"",""percentage"":0.008565}",facebook,"lower_bound: 100, upper_bound: 1000",en

My Labour opponent in this election, in his position as a Darlington Councillor, has not once but TWICE proposed building 350 houses on OUR airport, supporting Peel's awful plans to close it - and then accepted a place on the airport board with Peel!!! 😡

He has tried to avoid speaking about this, and it seems the Labour Party had locked him away from the public during this election, but yesterday he was caught out live on the BBC debate and had no answer when he was presented with the council documents (with his name on!) that prove all of this 📜

The airport is absolutely vital when securing global investment from the likes of SeAH Wind who are creating 2️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ jobs, bp and NZT spending £4️⃣billion at the former steelworks site, or global cargo giants FedEx moving their operation to Teesside.

🏖️ We are tuning the airport around with new holiday flights to Alicante, Faro, Corfu and everywhere in-between 🇪🇸🇵🇹🇬🇷🇧🇬🇳🇱🇹🇷

🏆 We have been crowned UK Airport of the Year and saw RECORD passenger numbers last summer.

... BUT we are not done yet and though we are AHEAD of schedule, we need to keep pushing ahead with our 10 year plan! 💪

ACTIONS ALWAYS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS and what is absolutely clear is that whilst we have turned the airport around, Chris McEwan (my Labour Opponent) wanted to GROUND our amazing local airport for good.

As our planet faces climate change, the conversation often centres around its physical impacts. But what about the impact climate change might be having on our psychological well-being?

Some research reveals that the stress, uncertainty, and loss from extreme weather events, has contributed to increased levels of anxiety and depression.

Psychological responses to climate change, like conflict avoidance, helplessness and resignation has also grown, according to a study by the American Psychological Association

But there are positives to addressing this topic… 

By acknowledging the link between climate change and mental health, we can foster resilience, promote sustainable practices, and support one another. 

Together, we can help each other understand and manage eco anxiety

🗳️ Vote for more progress on the 2nd May by backing me in the Mayoral election!

🧱 Over the past 7 years we have been delivering the building blocks to right the wrongs of the past and bring jobs and investment back to Teesside. 
We are seeing HUGE progress on the Teesworks site.

Over £2billion of international investment
9000 Jobs Secured
£1.3billion returned BACK to the local taxpayer in business rates ... and this is just the start  

But more than this, you can see the progress with your own eyes. The British steel being used in SeAH Wind's £650m factory is flying up, land has been cleared and made ready for BP’s NZT facility, and work has started for British Steel's new electric-arc-furnace firing the starting gun on Steelmaking returning to Teesside. 

In the years ahead, Teesworks will become the new ICI, providing opportunities for the next generation of Teessiders. 

And irrespective of who is in charge in Westminster – progress will not change. With devolution and the plans we already have in place this project is only moving forward, creating jobs and opportunities for local people to build a brighter future for themselves and their families.
The plan I’ve put in place over the last 7 years - to help our area succeed, to help businesses invest and to help local people thrive - is working so let’s see it through to the end.

Teesworks WILL become the new ICI, creating generational job opportunities.

💔 When the steelworks shut in 2015, 3000 people lost their jobs overnight and a sense of purpose was lost from our tight knit, hard-working communities.

This was an enormous injustice and one a promised to put right by RETURNING JOBS to that site. 

On just 17% of the site 9️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ jobs have already been secured. 

One step at a time we are restoring purpose and pride to the communities that were so badly impacted by the closure of the steelworks.

Everything we are doing is to provide JOBS for LOCAL PEOPLE and revive the areas that were forgotten by Governments of both colours for so long. 

With more opportunities and jobs, more people will have more money in their pockets meaning they can provide for their families and spend money in our towns again. 

This knock-on effect will help other local businesses across our area and see our town centres and communities begin to thrive once more.

They really should try to keep up.

On the same day Labour took to BBC Question Time to, once again, talk down Teesside, I visited the huge SeAH Wind Turbine Monopile Factory, set to open by next year along with Ben Houchen - Tees Valley Mayor .

It's an engineering marvel, towering at 40 metres and stretching 900 metres - as large as four Riverside Stadiums side by side. 

It's literally going to bring thousands of great jobs to our region.  So I'm afraid Labour are, at best, horribly uninformed, and at worst?  Deliberately misleading. 🥀

Alongside Ben Houchen, I've witnessed first-hand the strides we're making, from the New South Bank Quay to future carbon capture initiatives with BP, Equinor, and Total. 

Teesside's revival hinges on the success of projects like Teesworks. 

It's exhilarating to see such innovation taking root in our backyard.

Every local authority in our area has seen a surge in their employment rate, and Redcar and Cleveland, home to Teesworks, has gone from fourth to second place in our region.

As the second chart shows, the Tees Valley (the red line) has rocketed ahead of the rest of the North East and we are closing in on the England average fast.

This isn’t happening by accident.  It’s the result of the Treasury coming to Darlington, our Freeport, our Airport, our massive regeneration project at Teesworks, the new SeAH wind factory, BP’s carbon capture plans - and so much more.

It’s the result of our having a plan, and ambition, and positivity, and not adopting Labour’s traditional policy of blame and shroud-waving.

Wigan have applied to the Mayor's Challenge Fund (MCF) schemes aimed at improving walking, wheeling, and cycling between Atherton and Tyldesley.

Whilst we have some of the worst roads in the borough for congestion and pot holes, the Major Project Team should of applied for funding to reduce congestion and make our roads safer not applying for funding that is only going to increase traffic congestion.

I will be writting to the Major Projects Team outlining my concerns on this proposal and will ask residents to do the same.

The scheme proposes the following:
• Installing a new safe crossing on Bolton Road to access Shakerley Lane and creating a quiet streets route.
• Upgrading the existing Bridleway that runs the length of Shakerley Lane from the railway bridge to Lancaster Avenue.
• Traffic calming on Lancaster Avenue to include speed humps and safety measures on side streets, and tighter junctions to force motorists to slow down when turning.
• Path improvements proposed for The Common include enhanced surfacing and a wider replacement bridge.
• Changing Johnson Street and Primrose Street
North from two-way to one-way for motorists.
• A proposed new signalised green man crossing on Shuttle Street will link into Milk Street and on towards the guided busway.
• Removing an exisiting zebra crossing and relocating it appropriately 10 meters on Elliot St.

According to the latest investigation by @transportandenvironment Concawe has long funded studies contradicting the scientific consensus on the cancer risk posed by exposure to some chemicals linked to petroleum products. 🧪🚨

An activity that has dragged on over the years, lobbying against improving oil workers protection when bodies like the World Health Organisation and the European Union were proposing tightening the rules.

And who knows what the one million workers who are now exposed to benzene - a carcinogenic component of oil and gas - think of the recent failure of a proposal by the European Chemicals Agency to raise exposure limits for the substance.

We’ll then march to the BAE Systems offices nearby – another corporation fuelling war, conflict and the climate crisis in the pursuit of profit.

–

With world leaders gathered in the UAE for COP28, it’s time to rise up and demand action for climate justice. 

On Saturday 9 December, we’ll assemble for a rally outside BP headquarters – an oil and gas corporation making billions by fuelling climate breakdown and recently signed new exploration licences with Israel off the coast of Palestine.

After the rally at BP, we’ll march to BAE Systems headquarters – another company profiting from conflict and war – before we invite everyone to join the National March for Palestine to demand an immediate, permanent #CeasefireNOW.

There must be no more profiting from the destruction of our climate, our communities and our futures. 

–

Climate breakdown is happening right now. 2023 will be the hottest year on record. As the world heats up, extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and more destructive – leaving behind mass devastation and loss of life and livelihoods. Meanwhile, corporate profits continue to soar.

In 2022, five oil and gas giants made combined profits of over £150 billion. The world’s 722 biggest companies made more than $1 trillion on the back of soaring energy prices and increasing interest rates.

Prices rise, profits rise, the planet burns – but it doesn’t have to be this way. 

Join us on 9 December to demand climate justice.

These proposals include building two giant substations, with one alone being bigger than 13 football pitches and over 20 meters high, on our greenbelt and adjacent to two schools - Carr Hill and Strike Lane. So horrendous are they, that the developers BP still won’t come forward with an artists impression, claiming they don’t know what they look like. They also plan to construct a 120-meter wide cable corridor which will rip through the entire length of Fylde in an area wider than the M55 motorway. This project will cause massive disruption and render Grade A agricultural land useless, damaging the livelihoods of many local farmers.

Morgan and Morecambe, a partnership between BP, EnBW, Cobra, and Flotation Energy, proposes to bring their cables ashore at St Annes and cut through Fylde with a 100-metre wide cable corridor. This corridor, wider than the M55 motorway, will render acres of farmland redundant and potentially bring ongoing disruption to roads.

Additionally, the plans include constructing TWO substations on greenbelt land, areas of separation, and Grade A agricultural land in Kirkham, Newton, and Freckleton. One of these substations will be as large as 13 football pitches and 20 metres high.

I support the development of more green energy and have no issue with offshore wind farms. However, I have tried reasoning with Morgan and Morecambe to consider alternative cable routes and to utilise the existing substation in Penwortham.

Morgan and Morecambe, a partnership between BP, EnBW, Cobra, and Flotation Energy, proposes to bring their cables ashore at St Annes and cut through Fylde with a 100-metre wide cable corridor. This corridor, wider than the M55 motorway, will render acres of farmland redundant and potentially bring ongoing disruption to roads.

Additionally, the plans include constructing TWO substations on greenbelt land, areas of separation, and Grade A agricultural land in Kirkham, Newton, and Freckleton. One of these substations will be as large as 13 football pitches and 20 metres high.

I support the development of more green energy and have no issue with offshore wind farms. However, I have tried reasoning with Morgan and Morecambe to consider alternative cable routes and to utilise the existing substation in Penwortham. My opposition stems from how these proposals will harm our environment and disrupt the lives of residents.

We all know that ticket office staff are an essential service to many of us, especially more vulnerable passengers who cannot access ticket machines or online alternatives.

Stevenage Labour joined the huge campaign to make Conservative ministers think again:

- I joined ticket office staff at Stevenage promoting the public consultation.

- Stevenage Labour councillors passed a motion calling for the ticket offices to be saved.

- I wrote to the Secretary of State asking for a number of assurances.

- Stevenage Labour teamed up with residents to launch a petition.

Thanks to so many people taking action, it paid off! 

But the state of our railways is in a mess under these out-of-touch Conservative ministers. Join our campaign for a change of MP and government:

I am not satisfied that this will be the best option for our environment, given the known flooding issues in the area, the loss of high-quality farmland, and its close proximity to Carr Hill and Strike Lane Schools. This will have particularly devastating consequences for Newton, Kirkham, and Freckleton.

I have expressed my strong objections in meetings with directors from BP, EnBW, Flotation Energy and Cobra. I am not against wind farms and green energy, but this must be done in a respectful way for local residents and our environment. I have consistently urged Morecambe and Morgan to use the land surrounding the existing substation in Penwortham, which would be more appropriate.

9 July - 20 August 2023

Free with admission

Exploring themes of identity and control Wounded & the Art of Healing forms a vibrant new collection of paintings and drawings by contemporary artist Louise Burdett.

With figurative, abstract expressionist and landscape painting techniques mashed together we are taken somewhere between the conscious and subconscious to glimpse a journey of introspection, reconciliation and hope in the face of the climate crisis and humanity's uncertain future.

Louise lives and works locally in the waterside village of Lawrenny, Pembrokeshire.

At the Rumaila oil field near the city of Basra, active flares, burning off waste gas produce by the oil drilling process, emit thick plumes of black smoke as excess gas is burnt.

Flaring releases methane and dangerous chemicals like benzene — a carcinogen also found in cigarettes — into the atmosphere. Not only is the pollution contributing to high rates of leukaemia and other cancers among those living in nearby towns, it is also a huge problem for the climate. 

BP and other international oil companies working in this part of the world have made hundreds of millions of pounds over the last decade. During that time, flaring has been out of control. But loopholes in emissions reporting rules mean that this has remained out of sight from shareholders and the wider public.

Greenpeace’s investigative journalism arm Unearthed spent months examining Iraq’s oil industry and seeing how emissions data from the country measured up against big oil’s climate claims. Alongside the BBC on the ground in Iraq, the result was an unprecedented insight into a country where people are forced to live in an environment shaped by the oil industry. 

BP’s share of flaring emissions from Rumaila stood at 4.52 million tonnes CO2e in 2021. That’s close to double the emissions caused by flaring from the entire UK oil industry the same year — or the equivalent annual emissions of over 970,000 petrol cars.

BP claims to be making progress reducing flaring and has pledged to stop the practice for everything but emergencies by 2030. But Unearthed learned that the company does not include Rumaila in its figures because it classifies the field as a non-operated asset. If it did, its global flaring emission figures for 2021 would double.

There are other fields where international oil companies, owing to this “non-operated” loophole, can earn hundreds of millions of dollars without ever declaring the related emissions. 

On a global scale, flaring is a major source of methane, a superheating greenhouse gas 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide during its first 20 years in the atmosphere. The climate cannot afford for companies to continue burning gas on this scale.

Iraq is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to climate change. Temperatures in Basra now regularly approach 50C in summer. Water scarcity and the loss of farmland to desertification are immediate concerns for people and their livelihoods. 

Diversifying the economy is another challenge — 99% of the country’s export revenue came from oil in the last decade. Despite the country's abundant fossil fuel reserves, most Iraqis struggle with power cuts and the country is heavily dependent on neighbouring Iran for electricity generation.

To stop runaway global warming, we must cut methane emissions. Oil giants, like BP, must make real commitments to reducing fossil fuel extraction and the burning of natural gas if we are to stop irreversible climate change. Not only for the communities suffering in Rumaila, but for every person experiencing the devastating effects of climate breakdown worldwide.

That’s why at Greenpeace, we work tirelessly to expose the corporations and governments working to exploit our natural world for profit. Through our investigations unit at Unearthed, we will continue to reveal those responsible for environmental destruction and shed light on the areas of operation that they would rather stay in the dark. 

But we need your support to continue investigating, documenting, and uncovering the truth.

Iraq is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to climate change. Temperatures in Basra now regularly approach 50C in summer. Water scarcity and the loss of farmland to desertification are immediate concerns for people and their livelihoods. 

Diversifying the economy is another challenge — 99% of the country’s export revenue came from oil in the last decade. Despite the country's abundant fossil fuel reserves, most Iraqis struggle with power cuts and the country is heavily dependent on neighbouring Iran for electricity generation.

To stop runaway global warming, we must cut methane emissions. Oil giants, like BP, must make real commitments to reducing fossil fuel extraction and the burning of natural gas if we are to stop irreversible climate change. Not only for the communities suffering in Rumaila, but for every person experiencing the devastating effects of climate breakdown worldwide.

That’s why at Greenpeace, we work tirelessly to expose the corporations and governments working to exploit our natural world for profit. Through our investigations unit at Unearthed, we will continue to reveal those responsible for environmental destruction and shed light on the areas of operation that they would rather stay in the dark. 

But we need your support to continue investigating, documenting, and uncovering the truth.

At the Rumaila oil field near the city of Basra, active flares, burning off waste gas produce by the oil drilling process, emit thick plumes of black smoke as excess gas is burnt.

Flaring releases methane and dangerous chemicals like benzene — a carcinogen also found in cigarettes — into the atmosphere. Not only is the pollution contributing to high rates of leukaemia and other cancers among those living in nearby towns, it is also a huge problem for the climate. 

BP and other international oil companies working in this part of the world have made hundreds of millions of pounds over the last decade. During that time, flaring has been out of control. But loopholes in emissions reporting rules mean that this has remained out of sight from shareholders and the wider public.

Greenpeace’s investigative journalism arm Unearthed spent months examining Iraq’s oil industry and seeing how emissions data from the country measured up against big oil’s climate claims. Alongside the BBC on the ground in Iraq, the result was an unprecedented insight into a country where people are forced to live in an environment shaped by the oil industry. 

BP’s share of flaring emissions from Rumaila stood at 4.52 million tonnes CO2e in 2021. That’s close to double the emissions caused by flaring from the entire UK oil industry the same year — or the equivalent annual emissions of over 970,000 petrol cars.

BP claims to be making progress reducing flaring and has pledged to stop the practice for everything but emergencies by 2030. But Unearthed learned that the company does not include Rumaila in its figures because it classifies the field as a non-operated asset.

Socialist Party representative Amy Ferguson will contest the local election in Omagh on Thursday 18th May. Ms Ferguson (25) is a leading activist with Unite Hospitality, organising workers in the sector to campaign for better pay and conditions. Over the last year, she has helped organise local protests in response to the cost-of-living crisis and paramilitary attacks, and supported workers on strike.

A member of socialist-feminist group ROSA, Ms Ferguson has taken part in campaigns for abortion access and against gender-based violence. She spoke at the COP26 climate demonstrations alongside Greta Thunberg and organised local Earth Strike rallies. Ms Ferguson is also a member of the Omagh Pride committee.

Speaking on her candidacy, Ms Ferguson said:
“Capitalism is creating nothing but crisis and insecurity for workers and young people. We are being driven deeper into poverty, and climate change threatens our future while the likes of Shell and BP make record profits. Nothing better sums up this sick system. Locally, sectarian deadlock is allowing the growth of forces which aim to drag us back into conflict.”

“We can and must fight back. Over the last year, I’ve stood on many picket lines alongside workers fighting for pay justice. The trade union movement has also brought people onto the streets against paramilitary violence. While local communities resist toxic mining, young people around the globe are standing up against environmental destruction, misogyny and LGBTQ+phobia.”

“I’m standing to provide a voice for these struggles and to help build the fightback locally. We need an anti-sectarian, socialist alternative to the dead-end politics on offer from the main parties.”

501376885532230,299227550122220,"Radio Cina Internazionale",2023-02-14,2023-02-14,2023-02-16,,"#Inaltreparole #Sostenibilità ed impatto sociale delle imprese cinesi
#KPMG ha elaborato un prospetto in cui analizza i report di sostenibilità delle imprese cinesi. Emerge un trend interessante in tre ambiti specifici che ci fa prendere coscienza di come il tema della sostenibilità sociale ed ambientale stia entrando nelle corde profonde delle aziende cinesi.

Soddisfare i bisogni della generazione presente senza compromettere le possibilità di quelle future è una scommessa che il mondo imprenditoriale pubblico e privato sta cercando di affrontare, immaginando uno sviluppo sostenibile. La necessità di rispondere in modo innovativo, costruendo un nuovo pensiero e sviluppando una criticità diversa sul mondo, ha spinto le Nazioni Unite ad individuare una serie di azioni (17 in totale) che rappresentano gli Obbiettivi dello Sviluppo Sostenibile, contenuti all’interno dell’Agenda 2030. In questo solco, le aziende possono dare il proprio contributo alla causa compiendo scelte che impattino positivamente sulla Terra, le persone e le economie. La fotografia dell’impegno dell’impresa su questi temi viene rappresentata dal Report di sostenibilità che sempre più aziende stanno adottando.
La famosa società di consulenza KPMG ha recentemente pubblicato un prospetto che analizza i report di sostenibilità di 5.800 imprese, dislocate in 58 paesi ed aree diverse del mondo. Con riferimento alle imprese G250, ossia le 250 maggiori aziende al mondo per fatturato in base alla classifica stilata da Fortune, si evince che quasi la totalità ha pubblicato un rapporto di sostenibilità. Ricordiamo che il numero di imprese cinesi G250 è cresciuto a 74 nel 2022, rispetto alle 61 unità del 2020, rappresentando il 30% del totale. E tra le N100, i campioni mondiali delle prime 100 aziende per fatturato, il 79% adotta un Report di sostenibilità. Anche in questo ambito il peso della Cina è cresciuto negli ultimi anni, arrivando a quota 89% nel 2022. Tra esse il 61% ha adottato il report ESG (rendicontazione ambientale, sociale e di governance). Un passo importante che vede una netta tendenza da parte delle imprese cinesi ad adeguarsi alla media mondiale. La Cina, sottolinea KPMG, «sta lavorando su aree chiave, come la conservazione ecologica e la protezione dell'ambiente, e sta ottenendo il sostegno di un ampio spettro di stakeholder per esplorare nuove possibilità di rendicontazione della sostenibilità sullo sfondo di uno sviluppo verde».
Da questo report emergono tre indirizzi fondamentali che caratterizzano l’attività delle imprese cinesi: l’analisi dei dati ed il coinvolgimento dei soggetti che partecipano al processo aziendale, l’approccio proattivo al cambiamento climatico ed all’esigenza di rispondere agli obiettivi di riduzione delle emissioni di carbonio e l’aumento degli standard ESG. Il tema della riduzione delle emissioni è cruciale. Del percorso cinese alla de-carbonizzazione ne abbiamo già parlato in passato , quello che è importante sottolineare alla luce di questo report è che tale obiettivo è perseguito dalle imprese cinesi non solo per dare un contributo materiale agli obiettivi “dual carbon” ma, come fa notare Wei Lin di KPMG China, anche per «mantenere il loro primato, sfruttando il valore potenziale e la resilienza delle loro aziende in un ambiente sempre più competitivo». Ma il tema del percorso verso la progressiva de-carbonizzazione diventa cruciale anche alla luce delle scelte fatte dall’Europa in tema di energia. A seguito delle sanzioni imposte alla Federazione Russa, l’Europa aumenterà il proprio consumo di carbone fino al 2025 ed ha già contribuito in misura massiccia all’aumento dell’1,2% di consumo globale di carbone, registrato lo scorso anno. @Francesco Maringiò

🤝She also gave credit to Anglesey’s Plaid Council and others for supporting the bid and putting jobs and the Union before party politics.

The major regeneration of the town centre centre is about to begin. The Council have engaged GL Hearn and Hemmingway Design - two major names in regeneration - to produce the new masterplan for Hyde Town centre.

The beginning of this work is a Thunderclap survey that I am asking EVERY Hyde resident to fill in. It's also applicable if you live in the area around Hyde, so ideally everyone in the neighbouring towns would also complete it.

I want this to be one of the most significant moments in Hyde's history, but it will only work by people giving their candid and considered views. We need some real proposals to come out of this process and the timescale is ambitious to get things moving.

Most of us are aware of the ever-increasing pressures on primary care and hospitals, and our own challenges in getting appointments. But what if there was a way of getting help to people more efficiently, using technology? That’s exactly what is happening with primary care in parts of North Dorset. @[100030003943677:2048:The Blackmore Vale Partnership] manages GP practices in Shaftesbury, Gillingham, and Sturminster Newton, and it has been busy trailblazing a new IT system to manage appointments.

Newly appointed clinical digital care co-ordinator Charley Davies explains: ‘Klinik is a nationally recognised system. It is used by 500 practices across the country, and it brings a uniformity to the service.’
As featured in the BV last year, @[100063888108877:2048:Gillingham Medical Practice], like so many others, adopted a new solution. At that time, Dr Chris Pearce told me: ‘Prior to the new system, Gillingham Surgery received 14,500 phone calls a month. Only 53 per cent of those calls got answered; there simply weren’t enough people to pick up the phone. It’s impossible to deal with that volume.’ 
Just think about that number for a moment – and that’s just one practice in Dorset. 
Others have the same problems; it’s not sustainable.

Who deals with what
I recently used eConsult (very successfully) at the @[100063452390106:2048:The Blandford Group Practice] and wondered how the two platforms, Klinik and eConsult, differed. Charley says: ‘Klinik offers so much more, and it also helps with choice and promotes a better service.’

So how is it all going to work when someone phones their GP? 
Dr Simone Yule, clinical director for the Blackmore Vale Partnership, is clear on the benefits. ‘Klinik will bring a uniformity of service. Whether someone rings the surgery or uses the website, they will get the same response. Part of the problem is the huge range of healthcare practitioners in primary care now, such as paramedics, physiotherapists and nurses. Knowing who is best to deal with an issue can be difficult. 
'With this new system, we can streamline patients to the right place and for the right reason. There is an element of instant triage (you can watch a video here to understand how it works https://youtu.be/RWygMMK1N-g ) – and there’s an actual clinical team looking at what is coming in on the system. So people will either get a face-to-face or a phone appointment. And it should then be easier to actually get that face-to-face appointment, because the system releases capacity.’

When someone uses the Klinik system, they are asked a series of questions which is a core part of the triage. It starts with the basics – so, for example, if you just have a query about a letter, you’ll go straight to the administrative team. Klinik is designed to reduce call time, so the issue of being told ‘You are number 52 in the queue’ should resolve. However, the system is not for emergencies. 
When you have answered all the questions, a calendar pops up where you can give a time convenient for someone from the practice to call you or to schedule an appointment. 

So what happens to the receptionists now?
Laura Grant, operations manager at Blackmore Vale Partnership, reassures me: ’The receptionists are really excited about it. It’s a new system, and it builds relationships with the team.’
Simone adds: ‘We think of receptionists as patient service teams here, because they do so much more than just be on reception and answer the phone.’

But what if you are unable to use the internet?
Firstly, the phone option is still available; but you’ll still answer all the questions, as the patient service team uses the same algorithms to assess your need as the online system. Then they will pass your request to one of the clinicians monitoring the system. And if you want to become more confident in using the online service, Charley is available to help you navigate the internet and use the various apps and technical services best.

Dorset as a county is using more technology to support people managing their long-term conditions and stay healthy. Verena Cooper, who is supporting the project, outlined the 'MyMHealth' app to me, used by people with diabetes, asthma and COPD. @[100064070048338:2048:NHS Dorset] is also implementing the 'BP at Home' service, where people can measure their blood pressure at home (and usually in a less stressful environment). In addition, there’s an entire library of online services on the Orcha platform, where all the digital applications have been thoroughly checked for safety and IT security.
Another exciting development in Dorset has been the DIIS (Dorset Information and Intelligence Service – pronounced dice) which uses anonymised data such as medical codes to help practices and primary care networks identify people who are at risk of developing health problems so they can be targeted for more support. 
Whether you like it or not, technology is here to stay in the NHS. From insulin pumps transforming the lives of people with diabetes to robotic surgery and innovative apps which help to manage chronic illness, times are changing. And the most exciting developments in tech and healthcare are when they make a positive difference to people.

Jacky Alty] and I have been selected by our friends and colleagues in the local Labour Party to be their candidates for Farington East in next year's local elections.✨

We do hope we can count on your continued support in May 2023 in supporting us at the 🗳️ by placing your ❌ next to both of us. 

Some of the projects we’ve worked on include;

🚮🗑️ Community Clean up day on East St/School St with over 2.5 tonnes of rubbish cleared away - and plans currently underway to transform this area into a community asset 

👷🚧Petitioned for successful resurfacing of Stanifield Lane, and worked with @[100064834925430:2048:Councillor Matthew Tomlinson] to deliver the resurfacing of Wheelton Lane - we continue to challenge LCC to revisit the speed reduction initiatives and HGVs using this road, but to date we still have been unsupported in our efforts 😞

🥳🏑Farington Fun Day delivered a success for a number of years - plans are currently being worked through to make this even better next year 🐑🐖

🏡🚌 Regular ward walks identifying new areas for bins (based on your feedback), new street signs, and working with our partners to deliver new bus stops and notice boards - all to improve the general feel and look of our community ❤️

And we continue to work on many more projects including;

🚸🚦The Stanifield Lane crossing - this has been a legacy project for a while now, but thanks to the commitment of funding from @[100068844415211:2048:South Ribble Borough Council] is finally moving forward - we’re hitting delays with LCC all the time but we continue to push back! 

🚧🚗 Bristol Avenue resurfacing - this was promised by the County Councillor under his election promises and then retracted afterwards - we will continue to push for this needed scheme…..
…..👌and many many more 

📞📲📧 We continue to work diligently for you and have responded to hundreds of emails, messages and calls from residents supporting them with their concerns and issues. 

Whilst it frustrates us 😣 that some things are out of our control (mainly potholes and speeding!), we do our best to influence those at LCC who can make a difference- and often we are successful. 

We’re so proud of the work that @[100069101084436:2048:South Ribble Labour] have done in South Ribble over the last 3 and 1/2 years and look forward to us doing even more in the future.

More and more of our countryside is being used for housing development when there are many wasteland fields in our urban environments. These could be old industrial sites, redundant buildings etc that are much better suited for new housing.. Please support and sign the below petition so that Parliament debates land use and hopefully sees the merit in protecting and retaining farmland for food production.

Like what we share? Spread it around, new audiences will help spread the word on political events ongoing.

“BP has reported its biggest quarterly profit for 14 years after oil and gas prices soared. The energy giant saw underlying profits hit $8.45bn (£6.9bn) between April and June - more than triple the amount it made in the same period last year.

The bumper profits have prompted calls for the government to tax firms further to help families with rising bills.

BP's profits were the second highest for the second quarter in the firm's history.
It follows a host of profit announcements from other firms including Shell, Equinor, TotalEnergies and British Gas owner Centrica, which have been reaping the benefits of higher gas and oil prices.

Dale Vince, the founder of energy supplier Ecotricity said BP was ""holding a shedload of money that is coming from hard-pressed bill-payers in our country"", adding he believed it was time to increase taxation on the profits of oil and gas companies.”

Biology Letters authors use ancient DNA to identify North East Arctic cod from an archaeological site in west Norway that is located at a more southern latitude than the current spawning range of this cold-adapted ecotype. Archaeological context and 14C analyses date these specimens to the late Holocene, when temperatures were warmer. These observations either suggest that the spawning distribution of Atlantic cod is not solely driven by temperature or indicate that paleoclimate reconstructions in this region are uncertain.

- MPs given vote on Windfall tax
- Local MP Choses not to to support it

Inflation is approaching double digits, real incomes are plunging.

40% of households are facing fuel poverty by October.

Life for working families is getting harder each day.

Last week MPs voted on a windfall tax on oil & gas producers that could have saved households up to £600 per year.

The Government voted against it.

Our MP didn't even vote at all.

Local residents have been left with ever increasing bills and new changes that mean price rises can be passed on to consumers even quicker.

But what about the oil and gas companies?

BP have admitted they have more money than they know what to do with.

We know what to do with it, give a share on this unexpected boost back to the public.

Help the struggling families that work all day and still have to choose between heating and eating.

We aren't talking about the companies that set your home tariffs here. We are talking about companies that dig oil and gas out of the ground.

They sell what they produce on the open market to the highest bidder.

A windfall tax wouldn't affect prices at all.

It would just mean struggling families might be able to get through the month.

We need action on the cost of living crisis and we need it now!

In response, the Chief Executive of NHS England stated that “it’s clear that the climate emergency is in fact also a health emergency”.

Scientific studies have proven time and again that air pollution causes severe health impacts and premature death. It is thought to cause around 36,000 early deaths in the UK each year. But, instead of taking action against the large polluting corporations, the Government shifts the blame to individuals who ‘choose’ to buy their products. It’s simply not right. 

A handful of the biggest oil companies that produce air-polluting diesel are responsible for as much as 35% of the carbon dioxide and methane released by human activities in the last 50 years - a significant contributor to climate change. Air pollution and climate change walk hand in hand regarding the harmful effects of these polluting corporations. If we treated air pollution as a health emergency, it would also mean action on the climate crisis.

But, even as the corporations’ own scientists warn that the continued extraction of fossil fuels could lead to catastrophic consequences, they pump billions of pounds into activities that pour scorn on climate science and thwart government action against their activities.

These efforts continue today. Advertisements by companies like Shell and Exxon claim they’re switching to renewable energy. But, in reality, Shell’s annual report reveals it’s still investing £25 billion a year in oil and gas – with no figure provided for its spending on low-carbon technologies.

Unless the existing fossil fuel infrastructure is dismantled, we have little chance of limiting annual global warming to 1.5C and minimising air pollution. Instead, the industry plans to spend nearly £4 trillion in the next 10 years developing new reserves. It’s a commitment to permanently damaging the planet - and our health.

But the biggest lie spun by the big polluters is that it’s a matter of consumer choice to use their products. BP, for example, has released a carbon footprint tracker – which shows they regard action on the climate emergency as a personal responsibility issue. 

At Greenpeace, we think it’s outrageous that the public is being blamed for causing the climate crisis and air pollution. 

Effectively tackling these issues demands the efforts of organisations that can put pressure on large corporations and call them out when they peddle untruths like these. We have worked tirelessly with our community of supporters at the forefront of this mission for decades.

On Saturday, hundreds of us took over the @[72228529722:274:British Museum] with a mass performance against BP sponsorship! We smuggled a GIANT @[345463602161853:274:bp] logo past security - and we didn't leave at closing time...🏛✊

Most UK arts institutions have now dropped their oil sponsors 👏👏👏 but the British Museum is considering *renewing* its deal with BP 😡😡😡

It's time for the museum to stop promoting fossil fuels. It's time to #MakeBPHistory.

In response, the Chief Executive of NHS England stated that “it’s clear that the climate emergency is in fact also a health emergency”.

Scientific studies have proven time and again that air pollution causes severe health impacts and premature death. It is thought to cause around 36,000 early deaths in the UK each year. But, instead of taking action against the large polluting corporations, the Government shifts the blame to individuals who ‘choose’ to buy their products. It’s simply not right. 

A handful of the biggest oil companies that produce air-polluting diesel are responsible for as much as 35% of the carbon dioxide and methane released by human activities in the last 50 years - a significant contributor to climate change. Air pollution and climate change walk hand in hand regarding the harmful effects of these polluting corporations. If we treated air pollution as a health emergency, it would also mean action on the climate crisis.

But, even as the corporations’ own scientists warn that the continued extraction of fossil fuels could lead to catastrophic consequences, they pump billions of pounds into activities that pour scorn on climate science and thwart government action against their activities.

These efforts continue today. Advertisements by companies like Shell and Exxon claim they’re switching to renewable energy. But, in reality, Shell’s annual report reveals it’s still investing £25 billion a year in oil and gas – with no figure provided for its spending on low-carbon technologies.

Unless the existing fossil fuel infrastructure is dismantled, we have little chance of limiting annual global warming to 1.5C and minimising air pollution. Instead, the industry plans to spend nearly £4 trillion in the next 10 years developing new reserves. It’s a commitment to permanently damaging the planet - and our health.

But the biggest lie spun by the big polluters is that it’s a matter of consumer choice to use their products. BP, for example, has released a carbon footprint tracker – which shows they regard action on the climate emergency as a personal responsibility issue. 

At Greenpeace, we think it’s outrageous that the public is being blamed for causing the climate crisis and air pollution. 

Effectively tackling these issues demands the efforts of organisations that can put pressure on large corporations and call them out when they peddle untruths like these. We have worked tirelessly with our community of supporters at the forefront of this mission for decades.

In response, the Chief Executive of NHS England stated that “it’s clear that the climate emergency is in fact also a health emergency”.

Scientific studies have proven time and again that air pollution causes severe health impacts and premature death. It is thought to cause around 36,000 early deaths in the UK each year. But, instead of taking action against the large polluting corporations, the Government shifts the blame to individuals who ‘choose’ to buy their products. It’s simply not right. 

A handful of the biggest oil companies that produce air-polluting diesel are responsible for as much as 35% of the carbon dioxide and methane released by human activities in the last 50 years - a significant contributor to climate change. Air pollution and climate change walk hand in hand regarding the harmful effects of these polluting corporations. If we treated air pollution as a health emergency, it would also mean action on the climate crisis.

But, even as the corporations’ own scientists warn that the continued extraction of fossil fuels could lead to catastrophic consequences, they pump billions of pounds into activities that pour scorn on climate science and thwart government action against their activities.

These efforts continue today. Advertisements by companies like Shell and Exxon claim they’re switching to renewable energy. But, in reality, Shell’s annual report reveals it’s still investing £25 billion a year in oil and gas – with no figure provided for its spending on low-carbon technologies.

Unless the existing fossil fuel infrastructure is dismantled, we have little chance of limiting annual global warming to 1.5C and minimising air pollution. Instead, the industry plans to spend nearly £4 trillion in the next 10 years developing new reserves. It’s a commitment to permanently damaging the planet - and our health.

But the biggest lie spun by the big polluters is that it’s a matter of consumer choice to use their products. BP, for example, has released a carbon footprint tracker – which shows they regard action on the climate emergency as a personal responsibility issue. 

At Greenpeace, we think it’s outrageous that the public is being blamed for causing the climate crisis and air pollution. 

Effectively tackling these issues demands the efforts of organisations that can put pressure on large corporations and call them out when they peddle untruths like these. We have worked tirelessly with our community of supporters at the forefront of this mission for decades.

In response, the Chief Executive of NHS England stated that “it’s clear that the climate emergency is in fact also a health emergency”.

Scientific studies have proven time and again that air pollution causes severe health impacts and premature death. It is thought to cause around 36,000 early deaths in the UK each year. But, instead of taking action against the large polluting corporations, the Government shifts the blame to individuals who ‘choose’ to buy their products. It’s simply not right. 

A handful of the biggest oil companies that produce air-polluting diesel are responsible for as much as 35% of the carbon dioxide and methane released by human activities in the last 50 years - a significant contributor to climate change. Air pollution and climate change walk hand in hand regarding the harmful effects of these polluting corporations. If we treated air pollution as a health emergency, it would also mean action on the climate crisis.

But, even as the corporations’ own scientists warn that the continued extraction of fossil fuels could lead to catastrophic consequences, they pump billions of pounds into activities that pour scorn on climate science and thwart government action against their activities.

These efforts continue today. Advertisements by companies like Shell and Exxon claim they’re switching to renewable energy. But, in reality, Shell’s annual report reveals it’s still investing £25 billion a year in oil and gas – with no figure provided for its spending on low-carbon technologies.

Unless the existing fossil fuel infrastructure is dismantled, we have little chance of limiting annual global warming to 1.5C and minimising air pollution. Instead, the industry plans to spend nearly £4 trillion in the next 10 years developing new reserves. It’s a commitment to permanently damaging the planet - and our health.

But the biggest lie spun by the big polluters is that it’s a matter of consumer choice to use their products. BP, for example, has released a carbon footprint tracker – which shows they regard action on the climate emergency as a personal responsibility issue. 

At Greenpeace, we think it’s outrageous that the public is being blamed for causing the climate crisis and air pollution. 

Effectively tackling these issues demands the efforts of organisations that can put pressure on large corporations and call them out when they peddle untruths like these. We have worked tirelessly with our community of supporters at the forefront of this mission for decades. 

One of the most impactful ways to fight against these corporations is through a gift in your Will. It will help us challenge their lies, hold them to account and build a better, cleaner future for us all.

""The Missing Bridge”!
Josephine is calling on the Council to replace the bridge which was taken down on Lady’s Mile path, Kirkintilloch, East Dunbartonshire. Taking down the bridge is a very great inconvenience to local residents who love making use of this bridge during their walks and nature explorations. She is also supporting the petition which has been launched by members of the local community.

Tell your MP you will not be taken for an April Fool in two clicks here - saveourrights.uk/heat-and-eat

It might seem madness to appeal to those knowingly causing the problem to do something about it however they respond to two things. Money and PEOPLE POWER, demonstrated by numbers. 

If we unite and all take action by emailing our MP’s they will know that they people see what they are doing and will not accept it. 

This will not be the only action though, we will be out making noise on the streets on -

> Sat 9th April - BRIGHTON - Churchill Sq - 12.30pm for 1pm start
> Sat 30th April - CENTRAL LONDON - details TBC - follow for more info
> WEEKLY - PARL SQ - Outside during PMQs - 12-1pm - bring pots and pans to bang

Plus we encourage outreach in your local areas. We have leaflets, stickers, and business cards you can download here - saveourrights.uk/resources

Lastly - why do we not tell everyone to just stop paying their bills? 

1. There can be numerous consequences which are hard to predict and we wouldn’t want to be liable for that. 
2. It wouldn’t help the millions who are not willing to do that, those on prepayment meters, the vulnerable, elderly and disabled. This is a campaign for ALL. 

However if you personally choose to make that stance or feel forced to then we completely understand and we do believe many will have to make that choice too. It will likely benefit the cause and highlight the issue too.

We would urge you to still take part in the Heat and Eat campaign as well though so we can enable ALL in the UK to be able to Heat AND Eat as no-one should have to choose. 

4.3million children and 2million pensioners should not be living in poverty in the sixth richest country in the world. Raise your voice for them and join the campaign by emailing your MP in less than one minute here - saveourrights.uk/heat-and-eat","Heat and Eat Campaign",saveourrights.uk,"We are facing a cost of living crisis that will plunge millions into poverty.

The war in Ukraine in not just a human disaster, with the threat of even greater military escalation and nuclear war. It also poses a huge thereat to the environment. One of the results of the war has been to drive up the price of oil and gas: this has  hugely enriching the  the giant global energy corporations like Shell, BP Amoco and Gazprom. 
Big energy and right wing climate deniers are using the war to try to try to roll back on the already weak climate commitments made at COP 26. 
Big US gas corporations are looking to further expand fracking as they see opportunities to make big profits  as European states looks to diversify from reliance on Russian gas. Locally we have seen fracking companies and their supporters lobbying to reverse the moratorium of fracking. 
For both peace and for the environment we need a a rapid and dramatic move away from fossil fuels to renewables. But to get that we will need to challenge the power of big fossil capitalism which sees   war and climate catastrophe as an opportunity to make even greater profits for their super- rich shareholders. 
We need system change to stop climate catastrophe and imperialist wars.","Fossil fuels, war, and the environment.","Fossil fuels, war, and the environment.","Fossil fuels, war, and the environment.

The need for global climate action is urgent, so it has never been more important to be part of a movement for good. At Greenpeace, our mission is to create a green and peaceful world that is fair and just. 

Greenpeace is a movement of people who care about the future of our planet. We work with climate scientists, politicians, youth activists, artists and Indigenous Peoples to make sure policymakers consider the environment first. We investigate environmental issues and hold business leaders accountable for their actions when they commit climate crimes. 

It's truly incredible how much Greenpeace supporters have achieved in the last 50 years. Powered by millions of actions and donations, Greenpeace campaigns have won some impressive victories for people and the planet by raising our collective voice. Over the past five decades, we've grown from a handful of people setting sail to stop a nuclear weapons test to an unstoppable worldwide movement of millions. 

Together, we kept the Antarctic safe from mining, we got a global ban on nuclear testing, and we stopped commercial whaling. We protected the ozone layer with Greenfreeze technology, protected areas of the Amazon with the Soy Moratorium, and kept big oil companies like Shell out of the Arctic. We pressured BP to slash oil production by 40% within 10 years. We called on the Government to commit to powering the UK with more offshore wind energy. And, after 10 years of campaigning, we celebrated the end of fracking in the UK.  

These successes have pushed us to fight harder to protect the planet. 

When the power of many is unleashed; when millions of people are all heroes of change; that is when we can interrupt the catastrophically sedate 'business as usual' mindset of politicians and corporations, and incite real systemic change. Greenpeace puts people-power at the heart of our campaigns. We help build campaigns to create change, working with communities to positively impact people, systems and, ultimately, the world.

But we can't win this fight alone. We need you to join us, and the most powerful way to do that is through a gift in your Will. You are the generation who can have a pivotal impact on whether we win or lose the battle for the planet. Join us and be the change you wish to see.

In response, the Chief Executive of NHS England stated that “it’s clear that the climate emergency is in fact also a health emergency”.

Scientific studies have proven time and again that air pollution causes severe health impacts and premature death. It is thought to cause around 36,000 early deaths in the UK each year. But, instead of taking action against the large polluting corporations, the Government shifts the blame to individuals who ‘choose’ to buy their products. It’s simply not right. 

A handful of the biggest oil companies that produce air-polluting diesel are responsible for as much as 35% of the carbon dioxide and methane released by human activities in the last 50 years - a significant contributor to climate change. Air pollution and climate change walk hand in hand regarding the harmful effects of these polluting corporations. If we treated air pollution as a health emergency, it would also mean action on the climate crisis.

But, even as the corporations’ own scientists warn that the continued extraction of fossil fuels could lead to catastrophic consequences, they pump billions of pounds into activities that pour scorn on climate science and thwart government action against their activities.

These efforts continue today. Advertisements by companies like Shell and Exxon claim they’re switching to renewable energy. But, in reality, Shell’s annual report reveals it’s still investing £25 billion a year in oil and gas – with no figure provided for its spending on low-carbon technologies.

Unless the existing fossil fuel infrastructure is dismantled, we have little chance of limiting annual global warming to 1.5C and minimising air pollution. Instead, the industry plans to spend nearly £4 trillion in the next 10 years developing new reserves. It’s a commitment to permanently damaging the planet - and our health.

But the biggest lie spun by the big polluters is that it’s a matter of consumer choice to use their products. BP, for example, has released a carbon footprint tracker – which shows they regard action on the climate emergency as a personal responsibility issue. 

At Greenpeace, we think it’s outrageous that the public is being blamed for causing the climate crisis and air pollution. 

Effectively tackling these issues demands the efforts of organisations that can put pressure on large corporations and call them out when they peddle untruths like these. We have worked tirelessly with our community of supporters at the forefront of this mission for decades.

The need for global climate action is urgent, so it has never been more important to be part of a movement for good. At Greenpeace, our mission is to create a green and peaceful world that is fair and just. 

Greenpeace is a movement of people who care about the future of our planet. We work with climate scientists, politicians, youth activists, artists and Indigenous Peoples to make sure policymakers consider the environment first. We investigate environmental issues and hold business leaders accountable for their actions when they commit climate crimes. 

It's truly incredible how much Greenpeace supporters have achieved in the last 50 years. Powered by millions of actions and donations, Greenpeace campaigns have won some impressive victories for people and the planet by raising our collective voice. Over the past five decades, we've grown from a handful of people setting sail to stop a nuclear weapons test to an unstoppable worldwide movement of millions. 

Together, we kept the Antarctic safe from mining, we got a global ban on nuclear testing, and we stopped commercial whaling. We protected the ozone layer with Greenfreeze technology, protected areas of the Amazon with the Soy Moratorium, and kept big oil companies like Shell out of the Arctic. We pressured BP to slash oil production by 40% within 10 years. We called on the Government to commit to powering the UK with more offshore wind energy. And, after 10 years of campaigning, we celebrated the end of fracking in the UK.  

These successes have pushed us to fight harder to protect the planet. 

When the power of many is unleashed; when millions of people are all heroes of change; that is when we can interrupt the catastrophically sedate 'business as usual' mindset of politicians and corporations, and incite real systemic change. Greenpeace puts people-power at the heart of our campaigns. We help build campaigns to create change, working with communities to positively impact people, systems and, ultimately, the world.

But we can't win this fight alone. We need you to join us, and the most powerful way to do that is through a gift in your Will. You are the generation who can have a pivotal impact on whether we win or lose the battle for the planet. Join us and be the change you wish to see.

In response, the Chief Executive of NHS England stated that “it’s clear that the climate emergency is in fact also a health emergency”.

Scientific studies have proven time and again that air pollution causes severe health impacts and premature death. It is thought to cause around 36,000 early deaths in the UK each year. But, instead of taking action against the large polluting corporations, the Government shifts the blame to individuals who ‘choose’ to buy their products. It’s simply not right. 

A handful of the biggest oil companies that produce air-polluting diesel are responsible for as much as 35% of the carbon dioxide and methane released by human activities in the last 50 years - a significant contributor to climate change. Air pollution and climate change walk hand in hand regarding the harmful effects of these polluting corporations. If we treated air pollution as a health emergency, it would also mean action on the climate crisis.

But, even as the corporations’ own scientists warn that the continued extraction of fossil fuels could lead to catastrophic consequences, they pump billions of pounds into activities that pour scorn on climate science and thwart government action against their activities.

These efforts continue today. Advertisements by companies like Shell and Exxon claim they’re switching to renewable energy. But, in reality, Shell’s annual report reveals it’s still investing £25 billion a year in oil and gas – with no figure provided for its spending on low-carbon technologies.

Unless the existing fossil fuel infrastructure is dismantled, we have little chance of limiting annual global warming to 1.5C and minimising air pollution. Instead, the industry plans to spend nearly £4 trillion in the next 10 years developing new reserves. It’s a commitment to permanently damaging the planet - and our health.

But the biggest lie spun by the big polluters is that it’s a matter of consumer choice to use their products. BP, for example, has released a carbon footprint tracker – which shows they regard action on the climate emergency as a personal responsibility issue. 

At Greenpeace, we think it’s outrageous that the public is being blamed for causing the climate crisis and air pollution. 

Effectively tackling these issues demands the efforts of organisations that can put pressure on large corporations and call them out when they peddle untruths like these. We have worked tirelessly with our community of supporters at the forefront of this mission for decades.

These efforts continue today. Advertisements by companies like Shell and Exxon claim they’re switching to renewable energy. But, in reality, Shell’s annual report reveals it’s still investing £25 billion a year in oil and gas – with no figure provided for its spending on low-carbon technologies.

Unless the existing fossil fuel infrastructure is dismantled, we have little chance of limiting annual global warming to 1.5C and minimising air pollution. Instead, the industry plans to spend nearly £4 trillion in the next 10 years developing new reserves. It’s a commitment to permanently damaging the planet - and our health.

But the biggest lie spun by the big polluters is that it’s a matter of consumer choice to use their products. BP, for example, has released a carbon footprint tracker – which shows they regard action on the climate emergency as a personal responsibility issue. 

At Greenpeace, we think it’s outrageous that the public is being blamed for causing the climate crisis and air pollution. 

Effectively tackling these issues demands the efforts of organisations that can put pressure on large corporations and call them out when they peddle untruths like these. We have worked tirelessly with our community of supporters at the forefront of this mission for decades.

The need for global climate action is urgent, so it has never been more important to be part of a movement for good. At Greenpeace, our mission is to create a green and peaceful world that is fair and just. 

Greenpeace is a movement of people who care about the future of our planet. We work with climate scientists, politicians, youth activists, artists and Indigenous Peoples to make sure policymakers consider the environment first. We investigate environmental issues and hold business leaders accountable for their actions when they commit climate crimes. 

It's truly incredible how much Greenpeace supporters have achieved in the last 50 years. Powered by millions of actions and donations, Greenpeace campaigns have won some impressive victories for people and the planet by raising our collective voice. Over the past five decades, we've grown from a handful of people setting sail to stop a nuclear weapons test to an unstoppable worldwide movement of millions. 

Together, we kept the Antarctic safe from mining, we got a global ban on nuclear testing, and we stopped commercial whaling. We protected the ozone layer with Greenfreeze technology, protected areas of the Amazon with the Soy Moratorium, and kept big oil companies like Shell out of the Arctic. We pressured BP to slash oil production by 40% within 10 years. We called on the Government to commit to powering the UK with more offshore wind energy. And, after 10 years of campaigning, we celebrated the end of fracking in the UK.  

These successes have pushed us to fight harder to protect the planet. 

When the power of many is unleashed; when millions of people are all heroes of change; that is when we can interrupt the catastrophically sedate 'business as usual' mindset of politicians and corporations, and incite real systemic change. Greenpeace puts people-power at the heart of our campaigns. We help build campaigns to create change, working with communities to positively impact people, systems and, ultimately, the world.

But we can't win this fight alone. We need you to join us, and the most powerful way to do that is through a gift in your Will. You are the generation who can have a pivotal impact on whether we win or lose the battle for the planet. Join us and be the change you wish to see.

This unusual proclamation came from a member of a new committee formed in the wake of a US announcement. A test had been scheduled for October 1971 of a five-megaton thermonuclear bomb on Amchitka Island, 4,000km across the Gulf of Alaska from Vancouver.

The ‘Don’t Make a Wave Committee’ were eager to prevent this detonation to avoid the death of local wildlife and the potential creation of a tsunami that might swamp Western Canada. This rapidly formed group, who set sail to try and halt the bomb, included many passionate individuals who went on to co-found Greenpeace; the Bohlens, Ben and Dorothy Metcalfe, Bob Hunter, Bill Darnell, and Irving and Dorothy Stowe.

Shortly after Marie’s boat suggestion, a Vancouver Sun reporter asked how they planned to stop the test. Caught off guard, Bohlen blurted out, “We hope to sail a boat to Amchitka to confront the bomb”. 

They had a boat and skipper willing to make the trip (60-year-old Captain John Cormack, who owned an 80-foot halibut boat) and a guiding aim. As Irving flashed the “V” sign and said “Peace” to end the session, Bill replied, “Make it a green peace”.

This hope for a ‘green peace’ fused the emerging ecology movement and the powerful desire for peace which inspired those initial protectors of our planet and future. It stuck in everyone’s minds and became the new name for the boat. Finally, Greenpeace became the name of this movement to defend the natural world from destruction via peaceful direct action. 

To remain independent, it was crucial that funding for this action came from ordinary people. In October 1970, a line-up featuring Joni Mitchell and James Taylor played a fundraising concert, which raised enough for this first Greenpeace voyage. 

Though the action failed to stop the test itself, it sparked a storm of publicity that ultimately ushered in the seas of change. The USA terminated the entire Amchitka nuclear test programme five months later, and the island was later declared a bird sanctuary.

From that fishing boat of people striving for a greener, healthier and more peaceful planet that can sustain life for generations to come, Greenpeace has grown into a global community. For over 50 years, Greenpeace campaigns have been changing the world for the better. Powered by people worldwide, we’ve had success in terms of pollution, arms, animals and habitats. 

Recently, in the UK, we have forced the Government to commit to banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030, and secured a commitment from BP to cut oil production. Greenpeace has also achieved a ban on the sale of products containing plastic microbeads, and received a promise from the Government to power every home in the UK with offshore wind energy within a decade.

Greenpeace remains independently funded by supporters like you, which means we’re free to confront the governments and corporations responsible for destroying our natural world, and push for real change. It also means we need your help to continue this vital work.

This unusual proclamation came from a member of a new committee formed in the wake of a US announcement. A test had been scheduled for October 1971 of a five-megaton thermonuclear bomb on Amchitka Island, 4,000km across the Gulf of Alaska from Vancouver.

The ‘Don’t Make a Wave Committee’ were eager to prevent this detonation to avoid the death of local wildlife and the potential creation of a tsunami that might swamp Western Canada. This rapidly formed group, who set sail to try and halt the bomb, included many passionate individuals who went on to co-found Greenpeace; the Bohlens, Ben and Dorothy Metcalfe, Bob Hunter, Bill Darnell, and Irving and Dorothy Stowe.

Shortly after Marie’s boat suggestion, a Vancouver Sun reporter asked how they planned to stop the test. Caught off guard, Bohlen blurted out, “We hope to sail a boat to Amchitka to confront the bomb”. 

They had a boat and skipper willing to make the trip (60-year-old Captain John Cormack, who owned an 80-foot halibut boat) and a guiding aim. As Irving flashed the “V” sign and said “Peace” to end the session, Bill replied, “Make it a green peace”.

This hope for a ‘green peace’ fused the emerging ecology movement and the powerful desire for peace which inspired those initial protectors of our planet and future. It stuck in everyone’s minds and became the new name for the boat. Finally, Greenpeace became the name of this movement to defend the natural world from destruction via peaceful direct action. 

To remain independent, it was crucial that funding for this action came from ordinary people. In October 1970, a line-up featuring Joni Mitchell and James Taylor played a fundraising concert, which raised enough for this first Greenpeace voyage. 

Though the action failed to stop the test itself, it sparked a storm of publicity that ultimately ushered in the seas of change. The USA terminated the entire Amchitka nuclear test programme five months later, and the island was later declared a bird sanctuary.

From that fishing boat of people striving for a greener, healthier and more peaceful planet that can sustain life for generations to come, Greenpeace has grown into a global community. For over 50 years, Greenpeace campaigns have been changing the world for the better. Powered by people worldwide, we’ve had success in terms of pollution, arms, animals and habitats. 

Recently, in the UK, we have forced the Government to commit to banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030, and secured a commitment from BP to cut oil production. Greenpeace has also achieved a ban on the sale of products containing plastic microbeads, and received a promise from the Government to power every home in the UK with offshore wind energy within a decade.

This unusual proclamation came from a member of a new committee formed in the wake of a US announcement. A test had been scheduled for October 1971 of a five-megaton thermonuclear bomb on Amchitka Island, 4,000km across the Gulf of Alaska from Vancouver.

The ‘Don’t Make a Wave Committee’ were eager to prevent this detonation to avoid the death of local wildlife and the potential creation of a tsunami that might swamp Western Canada. This rapidly formed group, who set sail to try and halt the bomb, included many passionate individuals who went on to co-found Greenpeace; the Bohlens, Ben and Dorothy Metcalfe, Bob Hunter, Bill Darnell, and Irving and Dorothy Stowe.

Shortly after Marie’s boat suggestion, a Vancouver Sun reporter asked how they planned to stop the test. Caught off guard, Bohlen blurted out, “We hope to sail a boat to Amchitka to confront the bomb”. 

They had a boat and skipper willing to make the trip (60-year-old Captain John Cormack, who owned an 80-foot halibut boat) and a guiding aim. As Irving flashed the “V” sign and said “Peace” to end the session, Bill replied, “Make it a green peace”.

This hope for a ‘green peace’ fused the emerging ecology movement and the powerful desire for peace which inspired those initial protectors of our planet and future. It stuck in everyone’s minds and became the new name for the boat. Finally, Greenpeace became the name of this movement to defend the natural world from destruction via peaceful direct action. 

To remain independent, it was crucial that funding for this action came from ordinary people. In October 1970, a line-up featuring Joni Mitchell and James Taylor played a fundraising concert, which raised enough for this first Greenpeace voyage. 

Though the action failed to stop the test itself, it sparked a storm of publicity that ultimately ushered in the seas of change. The USA terminated the entire Amchitka nuclear test programme five months later, and the island was later declared a bird sanctuary.

From that fishing boat of people striving for a greener, healthier and more peaceful planet that can sustain life for generations to come, Greenpeace has grown into a global community. For over 50 years, Greenpeace campaigns have been changing the world for the better. Powered by people worldwide, we’ve had success in terms of pollution, arms, animals and habitats. 

Recently, in the UK, we have forced the Government to commit to banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030, and secured a commitment from BP to cut oil production. Greenpeace has also achieved a ban on the sale of products containing plastic microbeads, and received a promise from the Government to power every home in the UK with offshore wind energy within a decade.

Greenpeace remains independently funded by supporters like you, which means we’re free to confront the governments and corporations responsible for destroying our natural world, and push for real change. It also means we need your help to continue this vital work.

This hope for a ‘green peace’ fused the emerging ecology movement and the powerful desire for peace which inspired those initial protectors of our planet and future. It stuck in everyone’s minds and became the new name for the boat. Finally, Greenpeace became the name of this movement to defend the natural world from destruction via peaceful direct action. 

To remain independent, it was crucial that funding for this action came from ordinary people. In October 1970, a line-up featuring Joni Mitchell and James Taylor played a fundraising concert, which raised enough for this first Greenpeace voyage. 

Though the action failed to stop the test itself, it sparked a storm of publicity that ultimately ushered in the seas of change. The USA terminated the entire Amchitka nuclear test programme five months later, and the island was later declared a bird sanctuary.

From that fishing boat of people striving for a greener, healthier and more peaceful planet that can sustain life for generations to come, Greenpeace has grown into a global community. For over 50 years, Greenpeace campaigns have been changing the world for the better. Powered by people worldwide, we’ve had success in terms of pollution, arms, animals and habitats. 

Recently, in the UK, we have forced the Government to commit to banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030, and secured a commitment from BP to cut oil production. Greenpeace has also achieved a ban on the sale of products containing plastic microbeads, and received a promise from the Government to power every home in the UK with offshore wind energy within a decade.

Greenpeace remains independently funded by supporters like you, which means we’re free to confront the governments and corporations responsible for destroying our natural world, and push for real change. It also means we need your help to continue this vital work.

Hundreds of people are moving oil barrels and assembling solar panels in a well-rehearsed attempt to send a message. Among them is Greenpeace volunteer, Lucy.

The police work against them, dismantling solar panels as quickly as Lucy and the volunteers can assemble them. Lucy wheels her oil barrel in front of a set of doors to the BP headquarters and locks herself and fellow volunteer, Janice, to it. They settle in for what could be a gruelling night, but they’re eager to be part of this movement. 

Lucy had already supported Greenpeace for several years, but ever since she saw the Amazon rainforest go up in flames in 2019, she has increased the time she spends volunteering. “During the Amazon fires, I started to feel an even deeper sense of loss for the natural world, at a level I’d never experienced before.”

Lucy engaged directly with the BP project because she was motivated by the urgency of the climate situation. In particular, the desperate need for us to move away from fossil fuels. “I decided I could no longer just sit and do nothing about climate inaction.” 

And so, there she was, racing against police to lock herself to a barrel where she and likeminded activists remained for 11 hours. If the police had not cut them out, who knows how long they would have stayed. They were uncomfortable, but energised to take a stand for the environment and its future. 

Lucy and the activists blocked all entrances to BP’s building, and succeeded in delivering their important message to BP’s new CEO on his first day. In no uncertain terms, they told Bernard Looney to switch to renewables, as our planet simply cannot sustain its use of fossil fuels.

Hundreds of people are moving oil barrels and assembling solar panels in a well-rehearsed attempt to send a message. Among them is Greenpeace volunteer, Lucy.

The police work against them, dismantling solar panels as quickly as Lucy and the volunteers can assemble them. Lucy wheels her oil barrel in front of a set of doors to the BP headquarters and locks herself and fellow volunteer, Janice, to it. They settle in for what could be a gruelling night, but they’re eager to be part of this movement. 

Lucy had already supported Greenpeace for several years, but ever since she saw the Amazon rainforest go up in flames in 2019, she has increased the time she spends volunteering. “During the Amazon fires, I started to feel an even deeper sense of loss for the natural world, at a level I’d never experienced before.”

Lucy engaged directly with the BP project because she was motivated by the urgency of the climate situation. In particular, the desperate need for us to move away from fossil fuels. “I decided I could no longer just sit and do nothing about climate inaction.” 

And so, there she was, racing against police to lock herself to a barrel where she and likeminded activists remained for 11 hours. If the police had not cut them out, who knows how long they would have stayed. They were uncomfortable, but energised to take a stand for the environment and its future. 

Lucy and the activists blocked all entrances to BP’s building, and succeeded in delivering their important message to BP’s new CEO on his first day. In no uncertain terms, they told Bernard Looney to switch to renewables, as our planet simply cannot sustain its use of fossil fuels.

Lucy had already supported Greenpeace for several years, but ever since she saw the Amazon rainforest go up in flames in 2019, she has increased the time she spends volunteering. “During the Amazon fires, I started to feel an even deeper sense of loss for the natural world, at a level I’d never experienced before.”

Lucy engaged directly with the BP project because she was motivated by the urgency of the climate situation. In particular, the desperate need for us to move away from fossil fuels. “I decided I could no longer just sit and do nothing about climate inaction.” 

And so, there she was, racing against police to lock herself to a barrel where she and likeminded activists remained for 11 hours. If the police had not cut them out, who knows how long they would have stayed. They were uncomfortable, but energised to take a stand for the environment and its future. 

Lucy and the activists blocked all entrances to BP’s building, and succeeded in delivering their important message to BP’s new CEO on his first day. In no uncertain terms, they told Bernard Looney to switch to renewables, as our planet simply cannot sustain its use of fossil fuels.

If, like Lucy, you can no longer watch as corporations damage and destroy both the natural world and our shared future, join us as we chart a better course.

BP is sponsoring Stonehenge while destroying sacred Indigenous art in Australia. 🤦🏽‍♀️

So we turned up at the @[72228529722:274:British Museum] with some fake BP reps and some Stonehenge drilling plans, to point out this hypocrisy...!

Last week, the @[213441154663:274:National Portrait Gallery] and @[100044467148284:2048:Scottish Ballet] both ended their BP partnerships. It’s time for the museum to do the same and #DropBP.

There is huge confusion around the words ‘Integralism’ and ‘integral’. Neo-scholastics today returning to Integralism are the very people who tend to oppose the integral unity of nature and grace! In consequence, they confuse an integral political order with theocracy and church authority with church power. 

It may be time to ask once more whether subsidiarity implies distributism and corporatism, and whether solidarity and dignity imply a society of ‘estates’ and ‘orders’ in a reconfigured sense, besides Aristotelian mixed government, rather than pure democracy. 

Today we need to re-echo Max Scheler (such a big influence on John Paul II) and Emmanuel Mounier, in asking what a specifically ‘Christian Socialist’ or ‘Christian Sociological’ politics and economics might imply. Also following John Paul II, we need to think more about how a correct Catholic internationalism can be matched by an integral incarnation of Catholicity within specific national and local cultures. The strange alliance of an ultramontanist and over-centralised church (as Pope Francis perceives) with liberalism and laicite within nations no longer looks sufficient and has contributed to Christian decline.

La conferenza, intitolata ""Virtue, Integralism and the Priority of the Social in Catholic Political Thought"", avrà inizio alle ore 16.30 nell'Aula 11 dell'Angelicum (indirizzo: Largo Angelicum, 1, 00184 Roma).

C’è una grande confusione intorno alle parole ‘Integralismo’ e ‘integrale’. I neo-scolastici che oggi ritornano all’Integralismo sono le stesse persone che tendono ad opporsi all’unità integrale della natura e della grazia! Di conseguenza, confondono un ordine politico integrale con la teocrazia e l’autorità della chiesa con il potere della chiesa. 

Forse è il momento di chiedersi ancora una volta se la sussidiarietà implichi il distributismo e il corporativismo, e se la solidarietà e la dignità implichino una società di ‘tenute’ e ‘ordini’ in senso riconfigurato, oltre al governo misto aristotelico, piuttosto che la democrazia pura. 

Oggi abbiamo bisogno di riecheggiare Max Scheler (una grande influenza su Giovanni Paolo II) e Emmanuel Mounier, chiedendoci cosa potrebbe implicare una politica ed economia specificamente ‘cristiano-sociologica’ o ‘cristiano-sociologica’. Anche seguendo Giovanni Paolo II, abbiamo bisogno di pensare di più a come un corretto internazionalismo cattolico possa essere accompagnato da un’incarnazione integrale della cattolicità all’interno di specifiche culture nazionali e locali. La strana alleanza di una chiesa ultramontanista e troppo centralizzata (come percepisce Papa Francesco) con il liberalismo e la laicità all’interno delle nazioni non sembra più sufficiente e ha contribuito al declino cristiano.

Watch as we take over the British Museum courtyard with a colourful, musical protest performance with RevBilly & Stop Shopping Choir. We fill the museum steps with giant banners and call for Climate Reparations Now!

The British Museum has a high-profile partnership with the oil giant bp, and is refusing to return colonially-looted artefacts. The museum therefore perfectly represents the historic damage caused by Britain's colonialism and carbon pollution.

During the performance we symbolically pulled on imaginary ropes, hauling stolen wealth from the British state, and hauling stolen artefacts and BP sponsorship from the museum.

They are planning to cut out a new small left lane for McDonalds.

Whilst this is better than nothing and will help a little when the queue is small (and may keep it that way for longer by properly separating out the BP traffic) it does nothing to address the issues caused when the queue extends past the B1052/Gallows Hill entrance. 

It still can be a dangerous and nerve-racking experience for local residents who need to join from Gallows Hill. It has been even more difficult since the queue is being sent down the hill leaving residents only one lane to join from.

It is clear a more comprehensive solution is still required.

How was the emergence of the far right in England experienced at the community level? And what can we learn from this experience about the present moment?

In his important new book, On Burnley Road: Class, Race and Politics in a Northern English Town , former ISRF Fellow Mike Makin-Waite draws upon two decades of experience as a council worker in Burnley to chart and analyze the rise of local nationalist movements. Starting with a description of the 2001 ‘northern town’ riots, the book explores these events’ historical roots, their local meanings, and multiple afterlives. For Makin-Waite, the Burnley disturbances and subsequent far-right successes were symptoms not of some primal popular irrationality but of a deeply rooted political crisis. This crisis, he argues, has yet to be resolved, and this is why our political landscape remains vulnerable to far-right agitation and reactionary populism. Csombining profound insight into local politics with careful historical analysis, On Burnley Road is essential reading for anyone seeking understand contemporary English politics.

Mike Makin-Waite will offer an overview of his book with responses from two experts on the topic: Councillor Afrasiab Anwar , Leader of Burnley Council since May 2018; and Dr Manjeet Ramgotra , a Lecturer in Political Theory at SOAS University of London and an ISRF Fellow working on ‘ Postcolonial Republicanism: The Indian Founding and its Impact ’.

We will be providing snacks during the session.

You will get the opportunity to see some experienced speakers perform a show debate on the motion “This House Supports open borders”, and ask any questions on the topic.

This will be followed by a chance to try out making arguments in a real debate - don't worry if you haven't done BP debating before or have forgotten the format as we will be explaining how it works during the session.

Finally, there will be a pub social after the debate, so please stick around for a chance to have fun and start making friends. You'll be able to get to know new people and ask our members questions about debating or university life in general.

We hope to see you there and look forward to having you!

Can't make it on Thursday? Come join us for our Tuesday taster session instead!

BP’s latest marketing campaign has ruffled a few feathers, to say the least. Their no-holes-barred, tongue in cheek campaign takes aim at both other petroleum companies as well as ‘climate worriers’, as their CEO calls them.
 
A spokesperson for the company has said,
 
“We want to acknowledge that climate change is a problem, we are aware of it and we’re doing everything within our climate department’s power to avert this crisis. Yes, it’s one guy but we don’t have the budget for more people right now. We also want to make the public aware that Shell is WAY worse than we are”.
 
Climate activists from around the world have piled on to the unusual campaign, with people both for and against BP’s new stance.
 
School striking mastermind Greta Thunberg said that she found the images, “Amusing” but suggested, “Jokes might be better left till after we deal with the crisis or even when we started to act like it is a crisis”.
 
Adding to her words, noted climate lover, Jeremy Clarkson said, “Petrol make car go brooooom”. Which caused a lot of people to say, “Wouldn’t he make a good prime minister?”
 
What’s your take on the latest BP climate campaign?

Join James Marriott, Terry Macalister and a wide-ranging panel for this special launch event marking the release of 'Crude Britannia: How Oil Shaped a Nation', published by Pluto Press, as part of Radical May.

---

Taking the reader on a journey from North East Scotland, Merseyside and South Wales to the Thames Estuary and London, this is the story of Britain's oil-drenched past, present and future; of a black gold empire built on financial power, political meddling and environmental destruction.

For decades, BP and Shell extracted the minerals, finance and skills of the UK. Working behind the scenes, Big Oil profoundly influenced the country's culture. Then, at the start of the 21st century, the tide seemed to go out - Britain's refineries were quietly closed; the North Sea oilfields declined. Now, while the country goes through the seismic upheavals of Brexit and the climate emergency, many believe the age of oil to be over. But is it?

The authors speak to oil company executives and traders, as well as refinery workers, filmmakers and musicians, activists and politicians, putting real people at the heart of a compelling story.

---

The panel on power, politics and climate will feature:

James Marriott is the co-author of 'The Oil Road' (Verso, 2012) and 'The Next Gulf' (Constable, 2005).

Terry Macalister is the former Energy Editor of the Guardian.

Caroline Lucas - Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion.

Gail Bradbrook – co-founder of Extinction Rebellion.

Jake Molloy – North Sea Trade Union organiser.

Suzanne Dhaliwal - Climate Justice Campaigner and creative.

This map gives you the best chance to make the most of your 3 votes. So whether your a life-long-Labour lover, loyal to the Lib Dems or a Green-to-the-core voter, you can give your vote to the candidates that have the best chance to win against the Conservatives in your ward.

Just click on the map and then on where you live. When your ward pops up you will see the most likely candidates to avoid having a Conservative councillor in your ward. 

Don't do the Tories a favour and split the vote as always happens here - If you split the vote you get Tories by default whether you want it or not!

Share this with your friends and family. Encourage them to vote. In local elections the turnout is usually so low that seats are won and lost by just tens of votes. So, every single vote matters.

To be clear this page is not supporting any party or candidate. We simply want non-Tory councillors to be able to hold the likely Tory council to account.

I’ve lived in Wealden for nearly 20 years. Moving from Eastbourne to Willingdon and then Hellingly. In Hailsham there are fantastic community groups and hubs, sports clubs for kids and independent businesses. What makes Hailsham great is the close-knit community and how it helps each other. This was prevalent last year, during the covid pandemic, where support groups were formed and stepped up to help the vulnerable people in our community and offer much needed help.
My background is in retail management for the last 30 years and I’m co-director of Sunflowers Mental Health and Well-Being in Hailsham.
Communities are only as strong as the services they rely on and over the past years there has been cut upon cut imposed by the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition and subsequent Conservative Governments, delivered by the Conservative led county council. Cuts to social care, cuts to mental health services, cuts to local policing and unsustainable housing developments. It’s time for change and get some fresh, positive thinking people into local government who will put the community first and invest in its residents.
My Pledges
Housing
Challenge and apply scrutiny to large scale, unfeasible housing developments that have inadequate infrastructure to support them. More affordable and social housing rather than ‘luxury homes.’
Community Safety
Restore neighbourhood policing and tackle anti-social behaviour and lack of respect for the community.
Local Services
Proper funding for mental health, social services, and transport including road maintenance.  Support small local and community business. Promote, encourage, and support local clubs and services especially those aimed at children.
Local Environment
Protect and maintain the town, communities, local parks, and areas of natural beauty. Support pollution and carbon neutrality initiatives.

The consequences for our jobs, businesses and economy will be catastrophic!

We warned that an SNP government propped up by the Greens would be the death knell of our offshore industry, even as it makes huge strides towards decarbonising the North Sea.

The technology centre was set up to lead the world in the development of clean energy and was funded by the Aberdeen City Deal to the tune of £180m only a few years ago.

This act of economic vandalism would betray the north east when the Scottish government should be investing in our economy. 

Avoid this by making sure you vote @[136308776480:274:Scottish Conservatives] on your list peach ballot paper - and especially not for any of the minor parties which split the vote. Splitting the list vote will let the Greens get an MSP in the #NorthEast!

I'm pleased that the Council have agreed to my suggestion of a plan for the future of Llanelli town centre. With funding from the Welsh Labour Government work is going on to develop ideas for a recovery plan for Llanelli.

On Saturday the report author joined me and other regeneration experts to discuss ideas to turn-around the town centre.

You can watch part of the discussion below. I'll be feeding all your suggestions into the Council.

They are also working hard to transform the business into a more renewable energy organisation. While it’s true that there are legitimate concerns about sales of road and aviation fuel, a recovery should come as we move through 2021, as the paradigm shift to electrification will take years not months to take effect. 

When you look at stocks that have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, BP is one of those that has the greatest potential for recovery now.  In fact, of the 19 stocks I bought during March/April/May of 2020, BP is the only one that is still showing a loss. That’s why I am doubling down on BP, after initially entering at BUY 1, I’m going in again at BUY 2. This will be a medium to long-term trade, as the recovery will be slow, I’m sure, but with a share price that is more than 50% below its 2018 and 2019 highs, it's one I’m prepared to back.

• increased rates of physical and sexual violence
• disproportionate rates of poverty and unemployment 
• a greater risk of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) due to the pause of prevention programmes around the world.

One of Womankind’s core beliefs is that grassroots women’s rights organisations know the needs of their community better than we ever could. We take guidance from our 45 partners in Africa & Asia on how we can best support local women and girls, building on trust that has been developed over years of working together.

With the increased demand for their services in the COVID-19 pandemic, The Vine Centre, Aldershot, are looking to the future and at how to best to support the people they have served in the past few months. 

Their idea is to form a new group – when suitably safe, of course – called “Culture Café” – to provide a space for adults to uncover their abilities and talents and to develop their hobbies within a social enterprise to provide skills, training and work experience to prepare them for jobs. The Culture Café would be open to adults of all ages.

The Vine Centre would love to have your input, so they have created two surveys: 
► one for people whom The Vine Centre support or who may be interested in attending Culture Café: https://forms.gle/SYAUNHRJW3uhizXSA
► one for people working with adults who may benefit from attending Culture Café:

- Share and Like to let others know - 

The 2005 Gambling Act transformed gambling in the UK - massively expanding and deregulating the whole industry. 

I was interviewed about it from #Wolsingham by Sky News yesterday: https://youtu.be/hO9bpOAqwFA

It's quite clear that the deck is stacked massively against ordinary punters and that with the explosion of online gambling we now have analogue regulation for a gambling industry that has gone through a digital revolution. 

The report is one of the most punchy the PAC has done. Full details and key recommendations and onward links are on my website:

Robert Wickham is a very interesting man who has been influenced by social reformers of the past and has a mission to make the Church relevant to the social problems of our present day.

Today religion is playing a more important part in many people’s lives than it did a decade or so ago even though the number attending traditional churches has declined.

Why is this and how important is it that faith organisations engage with communities not to just to increase their numbers but because they want to confront some pressing social problems.

Bishop Rob is passionate about civil society playing a major part in tackling the issues of knife crime, youth violence, school exclusions and poverty. Bishop Rob studied at the university of Durham, where he studied geography, especially urban regeneration, and perceptual geography.

He has worked in some Parishes before becoming a Bishop that were some of the most deprived in the UK and has been involved in the food bank and credit union movement.

What then does religion play in a society that faces huge social and economic problems.

And, that in turn, means that it now sports some of the highest dividend yields in the world.  

As dividend-focused investors, we are living in a golden age of sky-high dividends being paid by some of the biggest and best quality companies in the world.  

It is quite possible to build a diversified portfolio of blue-chip stocks with a dividend yield north of 5%, or even 6%, and that’s a great basis for any investor’s portfolio. But what if I told you there was a strategy you can employ that would boost that yield way up into double figures.  

Indeed, it does not rely on just one income stream. But four!  

Welcome to the revolution. The FIRE Revolution.  
 
THE FIRE REVOLUTION INCOME STRATEGY 

The FIRE Revolution strategy makes money by investing in some of the biggest and most boring companies in the world. Companies you will have come across in your everyday life such as GlaxoSmithKline, National Grid, BP, Aviva, ITV, Pfizer, Caterpillar, BP, and many more. The sort of companies that many income investors probably already own.  
 
The FIRE Revolution strategy makes money by relying on two things that are far more predictable than forecasting the future direction of a share — dividends, and the inevitable time decay of stock options.  
 
Now, if you have just seen the word “options” and tuned out, please don’t. They are as easy to trade as stocks.  You just need the helping hand of an expert to explain how.  

And — if used as I teach you — they are perfectly safe. 
 
In fact, selling options on boring blue-chip stocks is actually less risky than buying the stocks outright. Of course, like all investments, there is still a risk. But this strategy is firmly at the lower-risk end of the spectrum.  
 
I teach income starved investors how to sell covered calls and cash-secured puts using the FIRE Revolution strategy. The techniques are well known to bankers, hedge funds and savvy private investors. But the specific implementation is all mine.  

Over a thirteen-week group coaching programme, we will work together to teach you the exact real-world skills you need to go from novice investor to expert stock option seller. Not just the free content you can pick up on the web, but the essential specifics I’ve learned after slogging away at the coal face for many years. 

I’ve prepared a 16-page report that explains the whole strategy, just press the LEARN MORE button to download your free copy.","If you like dividends, you are going to love this…,Do you want to learn how to double your dividends?,How to boost your dividend yields into double figures",FIRE-revolution.co.uk,,"lower_bound: 15000, upper_bound: 19999","lower_bound: 200, upper_bound: 299",GBP,"{""age"":""45-54"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.352215},{""age"":""35-44"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.174922},{""age"":""55-64"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.315908},{""age"":""65+"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.156956}","{""region"":""England"",""percentage"":0.801408},{""region"":""Wales"",""percentage"":0.06825},{""region"":""Scotland"",""percentage"":0.104575},{""region"":""Northern Ireland"",""percentage"":0.025767}",facebook,,en

The ongoing slow-motion car crash known as Brexit has suppressed the FTSE 100 and it’s currently trading at a level that makes it one of the cheapest developed markets in the world. And, that in turn, means that it now sports some of the highest dividend yields in the world.  

As dividend-focused investors, we are living in a golden age of sky-high dividends being paid by some of the biggest and best quality companies in the world.  

It is quite possible to build a diversified portfolio of blue-chip stocks with a dividend yield north of 5%, or even 6%, and that’s a great basis for any investor’s portfolio. But what if I told you there was a strategy you can employ that would boost that yield way up into double figures.  

Indeed, it does not rely on just one income stream. But four!  

Welcome to the revolution. The FIRE Revolution.  
 
THE FIRE REVOLUTION INCOME STRATEGY 

The FIRE Revolution strategy makes money by investing in some of the biggest and most boring companies in the world. Companies you will have come across in your everyday life such as GlaxoSmithKline, National Grid, BP, Aviva, ITV, Pfizer, Caterpillar, BP, and many more. The sort of companies that many income investors probably already own.  
 
The FIRE Revolution strategy makes money by relying on two things that are far more predictable than forecasting the future direction of a share — dividends, and the inevitable time decay of stock options.  
 
Now, if you have just seen the word “options” and tuned out, please don’t. They are as easy to trade as stocks.  You just need the helping hand of an expert to explain how.  

And — if used as I teach you — they are perfectly safe.   
 
In fact, selling options on boring blue-chip stocks is actually less risky than buying the stocks outright. Of course, like all investments, there is still a risk. But this strategy is firmly at the lower-risk end of the spectrum.  
 
I teach income starved investors how to sell covered calls and cash-secured puts using the FIRE Revolution strategy. The techniques are well known to bankers, hedge funds and savvy private investors. But the specific implementation is all mine.  

Over a thirteen-week group coaching programme, we will work together to teach you the exact real-world skills you need to go from novice investor to expert stock option seller. Not just the free content you can pick up on the web, but the essential specifics I’ve learned after slogging away at the coal face for many years.   

I’ve prepared a 16-page report that explains the whole strategy, just press the LEARN MORE button to download your free copy.","If you like dividends, you are going to love this…,Do you want to learn how to double your dividends?,How to boost your dividend yields into double figures",FIRE-revolution.co.uk,,"lower_bound: 4000, upper_bound: 4999","lower_bound: 0, upper_bound: 99",GBP,"{""age"":""55-64"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.340437},{""age"":""45-54"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.335951},{""age"":""65+"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.194335},{""age"":""35-44"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.129277}","{""region"":""England"",""percentage"":0.799181},{""region"":""Wales"",""percentage"":0.068759},{""region"":""Scotland"",""percentage"":0.101501},{""region"":""Northern Ireland"",""percentage"":0.030559}",facebook,,en

In the last few years, the government has introduced a bunch of new regulations that have made it increasingly difficult to operate as a small landlord. Some of this is no doubt intentioned to make life better and safer for tenants — which is good — but much of it is undoubtedly designed to make life far more complicated and expensive for landlords. 

From the additional 3% stamp duty, to the phasing out of mortgage interest tax relief, to the new HMO licensing rules, to the higher Capital Gains Tax aimed directly at second homeowners, to the consultation to scrap section 21 evictions, life is getting a whole lot harder for landlords. 

Indeed, if you believe the surveys, droves of small-time landlords are just giving up the ghost and walking away. I can’t blame them.  

But why am I telling you this?  

Because there is a better way to deploy your hard-earned nest egg. 

Over the last couple of decades, I have researched, implemented, regretted, improved, and written about pretty much every source of investment going.  

And whilst I would always advocate diversifying your savings amongst different asset classes, one strategy has leapt to the front to become my weapon of choice… 

I call it the FIRE Revolution strategy.  

I run group coaching programmes to teach regular folks like you, how to generate repeatable income from some of the biggest and safest companies in the world. 

Although I’ve based much of it on my own years of real-world experience, the techniques covered in the programme, are well known and understood in the elite investment world. But, as with many of these things, the experts like to keep them to themselves. 

Your financial advisor will not tell you about this as there is no profit in it for him. And your bank manager is probably too busy trying to sell you their latest convoluted structured product. 

However, many financial institutions regularly use these concepts, and a certain Warren Buffett is known to love this strategy for acquiring new positions in the companies he buys. 

Indeed, as Mr. Buffett once said: 

“If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die” 

I couldn’t agree more, and that’s why I have written a 16-page report highlighting your path to financial independence, and it doesn’t involve a single buy-to-let. 

Press the LEARN MORE button to download your free copy of FIRE Revolution: The blueprint to your financial freedom.,With the latest raft of buy-to-let killing regulations due to hit investors in April, is it finally time to give up this once Great British investment? 

Along with the extra 3% stamp duty, the abolition of mortgage tax relief, consultations to scrap section 21 evictions, and a bunch of new rules around HMOs, the already hefty Capital Gains Tax (CGT) for second homes is about to get a whole lot worse. 

As of April, Private Residence Relief — the scheme that exempts the final 18 months of any growth in the value of a second home from CGT — is being cut. In 2020, you will only be able to claim 9 months’ worth of relief. 

And Lettings Relief is also changing. This tax break allowed accidental landlords to claim up to £40k of CGT protection if their main residence was ever let out. From April, this will only apply if you have actually shared the property with a tenant! 

Now don’t get me wrong, I’ve made plenty of property investments myself over the years and I’ve done pretty well out of them. But there is no denying, it’s a boatload of hassle having to deal with tenants, building maintenance, midnight call outs, and the like. 

And all this extra government legislation is enough to push a small landlord over the edge.  

So, what to do?  

If property is no longer a viable investment for income-starved Brits, where can you invest your nest-egg to generate a decent yield with relatively low-risk? 

Bank accounts are useless. With instant access accounts topping out at 1.5% and inflation running at 2.0%, you are actually losing money in real terms. That makes them a non-starter in my book. 

Or, of course, you could hand it all over to a professional. After all, that would be the sensible thing to do, wouldn’t it? 

Well yes, if you want to make someone else rich. Every layer of management that you put between yourself and your money means paying more fees and commissions. And all those small percentages soon add up. 

And of course, there are definitely no guarantees that the ‘expertise’ you are paying for is actually going to be worth anything. Just ask Neil Woodford’s clients what they think about active professional management. 

There are many other options you can consider…Peer-To-Peer lending, crowdfunding, bonds, tech shares, cryptocurrencies, and so on. Believe me, I’ve tried them all. 

But, decades of research, tens of thousands of pounds worth of training, and many false starts have led me to one specific relatively low-risk strategy that ticks all the boxes. 

And I’d like to share it with you. 

FIRE Revolution 

The strategy is called FIRE Revolution and it uses techniques well known to hedge funds, fund managers, and knowledgeable private investors overseas. But not — until now — your average UK investor. 

It is a strategy that can generate double-digit income from some of the biggest most boring blue-chip companies around. 

The sort of shares that are already stuffed into pretty much every pension fund going. 

Shares such as GSK, Lloyds, National Grid, Aviva, BP, and so on. 

The sort of shares that pay dividends of 5%, 6%, or even higher and that makes them great income producers in their own right. 

But the FIRE Revolution strategy takes things to a whole different level. It multiplies your investment to produce four different income streams. And that’s exactly what I aim to teach savvy investors on the 13-week FIRE Revolution group training programme. 

Interested? 

Press the LEARN MORE button and download your free 16-page report detailing exactly what’s involved.,I’ve invested in property for my whole adult life and — up until the last few years — it’s been very good to me. 

But, as I’m sure you are aware, the government has introduced a raft of new regulations that have made it increasingly difficult to operate as a small landlord. Some of this is no doubt intentioned to make life better and safer for tenants — which is good — but much of it is undoubtedly designed to make life far more complicated and expensive for landlords. 

From the additional 3% stamp duty, to the phasing out of mortgage interest tax relief, to the new HMO licensing rules, to the higher Capital Gains Tax aimed directly at second homeowners to the consultations to scrap section 21 evictions, life is getting a whole lot harder for landlords. 

And then, of course, is the sheer hassle of having to deal with building maintenance and tenants. If you choose carefully, you can still generate a low single-digit income. But, to my mind, traditional buy-to-let has had its day. The easy money has already been made. 

And I for one, have had enough. I no longer have any direct property investments. It has just become way too hard to sleep at night. 

But, luckily for me, I also have a second investment string to my bow and I’d love to share it with you. 

Over the last couple of decades, I have researched, implemented, regretted, improved, and written about pretty much every source of investment going.  

And whilst I would always advocate diversifying your savings amongst different asset classes, one strategy has leapt to the front to become my weapon of choice… 

FIRE Revolution 

The Brexit uncertainty is still taking its toll on the FTSE 100 and — by some measures — the market is trading at a twenty-year low. 

And that means that the FTSE 100 is currently stuffed full of shares yielding north of 5%, 6%, or even 7%. Pick the right ones, and the dividend payments will grow over time and outrun the damage wrought by inflation. 

Now, what if I told you there was an investment strategy that took those dividend-yielding shares and boosted the income way up into double figures. It’s a technique that is well-known amongst the financial elite and is successfully practiced by many private investors in the US and other parts of the world. But, so far, it has largely flown under the radar here in the UK. 

It takes a little time and effort to learn, but once you have mastered it, you will be well on your way to your own financial freedom. And it doesn’t involve the hassle of owning a single buy-to-let…

But, as I’m sure you are aware, the government has introduced a raft of new regulations that have made it increasingly difficult to operate as a small landlord. Some of this is no doubt intentioned to make life better and safer for tenants — which is good — but much of it is undoubtedly designed to make life far more complicated and expensive for landlords. The message is clear — the government does not want you taking care of your own financial future through buy-to-let. 

From the additional 3% stamp duty, to the phasing out of mortgage interest tax relief, to the new HMO licensing rules, to the higher Capital Gains Tax aimed directly at second homeowners to the plans to scrap section 21 evictions, life is getting a whole lot harder for landlords. 

And then, of course, is the sheer hassle of having to deal with building maintenance and tenants. If you choose carefully, you can still generate a low single-digit income. But, to my mind, traditional buy-to-let has had its day. The easy money has already been made 

And I for one, have had enough. I no longer have any direct property investments. It has just become way too hard to sleep at night. 

But, luckily for me, I also have a second investment string to my bow and I’d love to share it with you. 

Over the last couple of decades, I have researched, implemented, regretted, improved, and written about pretty much every source of investment going.  

And whilst I would always advocate diversifying your savings amongst different asset classes, one strategy has leaped to the front to become my weapon of choice… 

FIRE Revolution 

Brexit is taking its toll on the FTSE 100 and — by some measures — the market is trading at a twenty-year low. 

And that means that the FTSE 100 is currently stuffed full of shares yielding north of 5%, 6%, or even 7%. Pick the right ones, and the dividend payments will grow over time and outrun the damage wrought by inflation. 

Now, what if I told you there was an investment strategy that took those dividend-yielding shares and boosted the income way up into double figures. It’s a technique that is well-known amongst the financial elite and is successfully practiced by many private investors in the US and other parts of the world. But, so far, it has largely flown under the radar here in the UK. 

It takes a little time and effort to learn, but once you have mastered it, you will be well on your way to your own financial freedom. And it doesn’t involve the hassle of owning a single buy-to-let… 

Welcome to the revolution. The FIRE Revolution. 

I have written a 16-page report detailing exactly what’s involved. It’s called FIRE Revolution: The blueprint to your financial freedom' Press the LEARN MORE button to download your free copy.,With the latest raft of buy-to-let killing regulations due to hit investors in April, is it finally time to give up this once Great British investment? 

Along with the extra 3% stamp duty, the abolition of mortgage tax relief, plans to scrap section 21 evictions, and a bunch of new rules around HMOs, the already hefty Capital Gains Tax (CGT) for second homes is about to get a whole lot worse. 

As of next April, Private Residence Relief — the scheme that exempts the final 18 months of any growth in the value of a second home from CGT — is being cut. In 2020, you will only be able to claim 9 months’ worth of relief. 

And Lettings Relief is also changing. This tax break allowed accidental landlords to claim up to £40k of CGT protection, if their main residence was ever let out. From April, this will only apply if you have actually shared the property with a tenant! 

It’s clear that the government does not want you investing in property anymore. 

Now don’t get me wrong, I’ve made plenty of property investments myself over the years and I’ve done pretty well out of them. But there is no denying, it’s a boatload of hassle having to deal with tenants, building maintenance, midnight call outs, and the like. 

And all this extra government legislation, is enough to push a small landlord over the edge. Just imagine how much worse it's going to be if Labour get into power… 

So, what to do?  

If property is no longer a viable investment for income-starved Brits, where can you invest your nest-egg to generate a decent yield with relatively low-risk? 

Bank accounts are useless. With instant access accounts topping out at 1.5% and inflation running at 2.0%, you are actually losing money in real terms. That makes them a non-starter in my book. 

Or, of course, you could hand it all over to a professional. After all, that would be the sensible thing to do, wouldn’t it? 

Well yes, if you want to make someone else rich. Every layer of management that you put between yourself and your money means paying more fees and commissions. And all those small percentages soon add up. 

And of course, there are definitely no guarantees that the ‘expertise’ you are paying for is actually going to be worth anything. Just ask Neil Woodford’s clients what they think about active professional management. 

There are many other options you can consider…Peer-To-Peer lending, crowdfunding, bonds, tech shares, cryptocurrencies, and so on. Believe me, I’ve tried them all. 

But, decades of research, tens of thousands of pounds worth of training, and many false starts have led me to one specific relatively low-risk strategy that ticks all the boxes. 

And I’d like to share it with you. 

FIRE Revolution 

The strategy is called FIRE Revolution and it uses techniques well known to hedge funds, fund managers, and knowledgeable private investors overseas. But not — until now — your average UK investor. 

It is a strategy that can generate double-digit income from some of the biggest most boring blue-chip companies around. 

The sort of shares that are already stuffed into pretty much every pension fund going. 

Shares such as GSK, Lloyds, National Grid, Aviva, BP, and so on. 

The sort of shares that pay dividends of 5%, 6%, or even higher, and that makes them great income producers in their own right. 

But the FIRE Revolution strategy takes things to a whole different level. It multiplies your investment to produce four different income streams. And that’s exactly what I aim to teach savvy investors on the 13-week FIRE Revolution group training programme.

In the last few years, the government has introduced a bunch of new regulations that have made it increasingly difficult to operate as a small landlord. Some of this is no doubt intentioned to make life better and safer for tenants — which is good — but much of it is undoubtedly designed to make life far more complicated and expensive for landlords. The message is clear — the government does not want you taking care of your own financial future through buy-to-let. 

From the additional 3% stamp duty, to the phasing out of mortgage interest tax relief, to the new HMO licensing rules, to the higher Capital Gains Tax aimed directly at second homeowners, to the plans to scrap section 21 evictions, life is getting a whole lot harder for landlords. 

Indeed, if you believe the surveys, droves of small-time landlords are just giving up the ghost and walking away. I can’t blame them.  

But why am I telling you this?  

Because there is a better way to deploy your hard-earned nest egg. 

Over the last couple of decades, I have researched, implemented, regretted, improved, and written about pretty much every source of investment going.  

And whilst I would always advocate diversifying your savings amongst different asset classes, one strategy has leapt to the front to become my weapon of choice… 

FIRE Revolution 

I call it the FIRE Revolution strategy.  

I’ve spent the last year building a programme to teach regular folks like you, how to generate repeatable income from some of the biggest and safest companies in the world. 

Although I’ve based much of it on my own years of real-world experience, the techniques covered in the programme, are well known and understood in the elite investment world. But, as with many of these things, the experts like to keep them to themselves. 

Your financial advisor will not tell you about this as there is no profit in it for him. And your bank manager is probably too busy trying to sell you their latest convoluted structured product. 

However, many financial institutions regularly use these concepts, and a certain Warren Buffett is known to love this strategy for acquiring new positions in the companies he buys. 

Indeed, as Mr. Buffett once said: 

“If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die” 

I couldn’t agree more, and that’s why I have written a 16-page report highlighting your path to financial independence, and it doesn’t involve a single buy-to-let.

- dodaliśmy na terenie gildii pasek smoka u góry ekranu zawierający nazwę gildii, na której się znajdujemy (czym bliżej środka gildii jesteśmy, tym pasek się coraz bardziej zapełnia)
- dodaliśmy informację o tym, ile dostaniemy, a ile stracimy rankingu za zabójstwo danego gracza poprzez naciśnięcie na niego PPM (wyświetlany ranking może się różnić o +/- 25 punktów)
- dodaliśmy do gildii komendę /gpearl, która włącza i wyłącza otrzymywanie obrażeń od pereł, które rzucimy (dostęp do komendy podstawowo ma lider oraz mistrzowie, lecz możemy nadać do niej uprawnienia poszczególnym członkom pod komendą /opcje)
- dodaliśmy do gildii komendę /gnd, która włącza i wyłącza otrzymywanie obrażeń od członków / sojuszników gildii - gdy opcja jest włączona, członkowie / sojusznicy gildii mogą nas bić, lecz nie otrzymujemy od nich obrażeń, natomiast gdy jest wyłączona, to normalnie obrażenia są zadawane (dostęp do komendy podstawowo ma lider oraz mistrzowie, lecz możemy nadać do niej uprawnienia poszczególnym członkom pod komendą /opcje)
- dodaliśmy funkcję działania pereł przez otwarte furtki, natomiast podczas walki na terenie wrogiej gildii nie możemy ich otwierać ani zamykać (gdy nie jesteśmy podczas walki, normalnie można otwierać i zamykać)
- dodaliśmy na spawnie villagera, u którego możemy zamienić głowy withera na kilof 6/3/3
- dodaliśmy możliwość stawiania redstone'a w obrębie 50 kratek od terenu gildii, przez co nie będzie już problemu z budowaniem armatek
- dodaliśmy na tabie w nawiasach po nickach rankingi itd. wszystkich graczy będących aktualnie w topkach
- dodaliśmy śnieżki oraz śnieg pod /sklep oraz zmieniliśmy jego walutę na liście (każdego rodzaju)
- dodaliśmy komendę /tpa accept all / *, po wpisaniu której zaakceptujemy wszystkie posiadające aktualnie teleporty od innych graczy, natomiast pod komendą /tpalist możemy sprawdzić, kto się do nas w danym momencie teleportuje i również zaakceptować teleporty z tego GUI
- dodaliśmy incognito na ranking nad głową oraz ten po naciśnięciu PPM na gracza (np. gdy gracz posiada 1311 rankingu wyświetli się 1300+, natomiast przy 2091 będzie to już 2050+)
- wprowadziliśmy limit członków w gildii (max 100)
- wprowadziliśmy limit mistrzów w gildii (max 5)
- wprowadziliśmy logowanie dla non premium poprzez token BlazingPack (gracze posiadający non premium nie będą musieli się już logować hasłem na lobby - zostaną automatycznie zalogowani i przeniesieni na serwer)
- wprowadziliśmy limit strzał (48 szt.) oraz śnieżek (16 szt.) w ekwipunku
- zmniejszyliśmy zaklęcie 'power' na łukach z 4 na 3
- zmniejszyliśmy mnożnik diamentów na dołączenie do gildii
- zmniejszyliśmy ilość dodatkowych biblioteczek wokół enchantu dla rang premium (dla SVIP'a z 10 na 6, natomiast dla VIP'a z 5 na 3)
- przedłużyliśmy efekt regeneracji III po zjedzeniu refila z 3 sekund na 4
- zmieniliśmy wygląd serca gildii oraz system jej podbijania (więcej informacji na filmie)
- poprawiliśmy działanie grupowych teleportów (od teraz, aby się teleportować, w obszarze teleportu muszą znajdować się przynajmniej 2 osoby oraz gracze, którzy nie znajdują się w tym obszarze nie mogą już wciskać przycisku i teleportować w ten sposób innych)
- usunęliśmy z dropu z kamienia kulki szlamu
- usunęliśmy limity surowców (diamentów, złota oraz szmaragdów) z dropu w ekwipunku podczas kopania kamienia
- zablokowaliśmy spawn wiedźm, z których można było zdobyć m.in. wszelakie mikstury
- zablokowaliśmy zaklęcie 'infinity' na łukach (limit strzał w ekwipunku wynosi 48)
- zoptymalizowaliśmy nagrody dostępne za osiągnięcia (/osiagniecia)
- zoptymalizowaliśmy znacznie kod większości rzeczy na serwerze, przez co rozgrywka powinna być niemalże idealnie płynna i nie powinno być lagów, jak to miało miejsce na zeszłej edycji
Jest to oczywiście tylko część zmian wprowadzonych na tę edycję (więcej zobaczycie osobiście na serwerze).

Film z najważniejszymi zmianami, które zaszły na nadchodzącą edycję pojawi się dzisiaj (we wtorek) około godziny 19:00 na kanale YouTube ""Bremu"" (jeżeli film będzie dostępny podeślemy do niego link w komentarzu pod tym postem). ;)

Na nadchodzącej edycji rozgrywka będzie toczyła się na żelazne sety 4/3, żelazne miecze 4/1 oraz łuki 3/1 (moc/płomień). Siła I/II na beaconach została zablokowana. Niezniszczalność na setach została lekko ulepszona. Mikstury są zablokowane. Refile dodają efekt regeneracji III na 4 sekundy, absorpcji II na 2 minuty (2 dodatkowe serca (łącznie 4)) oraz odporność na ogień I na 5 sekund. Koxy oprócz standardowych efektów dodają również efekt szybkości II na 10 sekund. Wędki są odblokowane, a wybierany enchant od startu. Infinity na łukach zostało zablokowane. Limit na serwerze wynosi: 1 kox, 15 refili, 3 perły, 48 strzał i 16 śnieżek.

➡ Co do beta testów, prosimy Was o to, że jeżeli znajdziecie jakiś błąd na serwerze, żebyście niezwłocznie go nam zgłosili (znalazcy wszystkich błędów będą nagradzani).

A raft of new legislation is making this a difficult game to win, and that’s before you even begin to worry about any new legislation a Labour government may introduce… 

I think it’s fair to say: The good times for property investors are over. 

In the last few years, the government has introduced a bunch of new regulations that have made it increasingly difficult to operate as a small landlord. Some of this is no doubt intentioned to make life better and safer for tenants — which is good — but much of it is undoubtedly designed to make life far more complicated and expensive for landlords. The message is clear — the government does not want you taking care of your own financial future through buy-to-let. 

From the additional 3% stamp duty, to the phasing out of mortgage interest tax relief, to the new HMO licensing rules, to the higher Capital Gains Tax aimed directly at second homeowners, to the plans to scrap section 21 evictions, life is getting a whole lot harder for landlords. 

Indeed, if you believe the surveys, droves of small-time landlords are just giving up the ghost and walking away. I can’t blame them.  

But why am I telling you this?  

Because there is a better way to deploy your hard-earned nest egg. 

Over the last couple of decades, I have researched, implemented, regretted, improved, and written about pretty much every source of investment going.  

And whilst I would always advocate diversifying your savings amongst different asset classes, one strategy has leapt to the front to become my weapon of choice… 

FIRE Revolution 

I call it the FIRE Revolution strategy.  

I’ve spent the last year building a programme to teach regular folks like you, how to generate repeatable income from some of the biggest and safest companies in the world. 

Although I’ve based much of it on my own years of real-world experience, the techniques covered in the programme, are well known and understood in the elite investment world. But, as with many of these things, the experts like to keep them to themselves. 

Your financial advisor will not tell you about this as there is no profit in it for him. And your bank manager is probably too busy trying to sell you their latest convoluted structured product. 

However, many financial institutions regularly use these concepts, and a certain Warren Buffett is known to love this strategy for acquiring new positions in the companies he buys. 

Indeed, as Mr. Buffett once said: 

“If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die” 

I couldn’t agree more, and that’s why I have written a 16-page report highlighting your path to financial independence, and it doesn’t involve a single buy-to-let. 

Press the LEARN MORE button to download your free copy of FIRE Revolution: The blueprint to your financial freedom.,I’ve invested in property for my whole adult life and — up until the last few years — it’s been very good to me. 

But, as I’m sure you are aware, the government has introduced a raft of new regulations that have made it increasingly difficult to operate as a small landlord. Some of this is no doubt intentioned to make life better and safer for tenants — which is good — but much of it is undoubtedly designed to make life far more complicated and expensive for landlords. The message is clear — the government does not want you taking care of your own financial future through buy-to-let. 

From the additional 3% stamp duty, to the phasing out of mortgage interest tax relief, to the new HMO licensing rules, to the higher Capital Gains Tax aimed directly at second homeowners to the plans to scrap section 21 evictions, life is getting a whole lot harder for landlords. 

And then, of course, is the sheer hassle of having to deal with building maintenance and tenants. If you choose carefully, you can still generate a low single-digit income. But, to my mind, traditional buy-to-let has had its day. The easy money has already been made 

And I for one, have had enough. I no longer have any direct property investments. It has just become way too hard to sleep at night. 

But, luckily for me, I also have a second investment string to my bow and I’d love to share it with you. 

Over the last couple of decades, I have researched, implemented, regretted, improved, and written about pretty much every source of investment going.  

And whilst I would always advocate diversifying your savings amongst different asset classes, one strategy has leaped to the front to become my weapon of choice… 

FIRE Revolution 

Brexit is taking its toll on the FTSE 100 and — by some measures — the market is trading at a twenty-year low. 

And that means that the FTSE 100 is currently stuffed full of shares yielding north of 5%, 6%, or even 7%. Pick the right ones, and the dividend payments will grow over time and outrun the damage wrought by inflation. 

Now, what if I told you there was an investment strategy that took those dividend-yielding shares and boosted the income way up into double figures. It’s a technique that is well-known amongst the financial elite and is successfully practiced by many private investors in the US and other parts of the world. But, so far, it has largely flown under the radar here in the UK. 

It takes a little time and effort to learn, but once you have mastered it, you will be well on your way to your own financial freedom. And it doesn’t involve the hassle of owning a single buy-to-let… 

Welcome to the revolution. The FIRE Revolution. 

I have written a 16-page report detailing exactly what’s involved. It’s called FIRE Revolution: The blueprint to your financial freedom' Press the LEARN MORE button to download your free copy.,With the latest raft of buy-to-let killing regulations due to hit investors in April, is it finally time to give up this once Great British investment? 

Along with the extra 3% stamp duty, the abolition of mortgage tax relief, plans to scrap section 21 evictions, and a bunch of new rules around HMOs, the already hefty Capital Gains Tax (CGT) for second homes is about to get a whole lot worse. 

As of next April, Private Residence Relief — the scheme that exempts the final 18 months of any growth in the value of a second home from CGT — is being cut. In 2020, you will only be able to claim 9 months’ worth of relief. 

And Lettings Relief is also changing. This tax break allowed accidental landlords to claim up to £40k of CGT protection, if their main residence was ever let out. From April, this will only apply if you have actually shared the property with a tenant! 

It’s clear that the government does not want you investing in property anymore. 

Now don’t get me wrong, I’ve made plenty of property investments myself over the years and I’ve done pretty well out of them. But there is no denying, it’s a boatload of hassle having to deal with tenants, building maintenance, midnight call outs, and the like. 

And all this extra government legislation, is enough to push a small landlord over the edge. Just imagine how much worse it's going to be if Labour get into power… 

So, what to do?  

If property is no longer a viable investment for income-starved Brits, where can you invest your nest-egg to generate a decent yield with relatively low-risk? 

Bank accounts are useless. With instant access accounts topping out at 1.5% and inflation running at 2.0%, you are actually losing money in real terms. That makes them a non-starter in my book. 

Or, of course, you could hand it all over to a professional. After all, that would be the sensible thing to do, wouldn’t it? 

Well yes, if you want to make someone else rich. Every layer of management that you put between yourself and your money means paying more fees and commissions. And all those small percentages soon add up. 

And of course, there are definitely no guarantees that the ‘expertise’ you are paying for is actually going to be worth anything. Just ask Neil Woodford’s clients what they think about active professional management. 

There are many other options you can consider…Peer-To-Peer lending, crowdfunding, bonds, tech shares, cryptocurrencies, and so on. Believe me, I’ve tried them all. 

But, decades of research, tens of thousands of pounds worth of training, and many false starts have led me to one specific relatively low-risk strategy that ticks all the boxes. 

And I’d like to share it with you. 

FIRE Revolution 

The strategy is called FIRE Revolution and it uses techniques well known to hedge funds, fund managers, and knowledgeable private investors overseas. But not — until now — your average UK investor. 

It is a strategy that can generate double-digit income from some of the biggest most boring blue-chip companies around. 

The sort of shares that are already stuffed into pretty much every pension fund going. 

Shares such as GSK, Lloyds, National Grid, Aviva, BP, and so on. 

The sort of shares that pay dividends of 5%, 6%, or even higher, and that makes them great income producers in their own right. 

But the FIRE Revolution strategy takes things to a whole different level. It multiplies your investment to produce four different income streams. And that’s exactly what I aim to teach savvy investors on the 13-week FIRE Revolution group training programme.

THE FIRE REVOLUTION INCOME STRATEGY 

The FIRE Revolution strategy makes money by investing in some of the biggest and most boring companies in the world. Companies you will have come across in your everyday life such as GlaxoSmithKline, National Grid, BP, Aviva, ITV, Pfizer, Caterpillar, BP, and many more. The sort of companies that many income investors probably already own.  
 
The FIRE Revolution strategy makes money by relying on two things that are far more predictable than forecasting the future direction of a share — dividends, and the inevitable time decay of stock options.  
 
Now, if you have just seen the word “options” and tuned out, please don’t. They are as easy to trade as stocks.  You just need the helping hand of an expert to explain how.  

And — if used as I teach you — they are perfectly safe.   
 
In fact, selling options on boring blue-chip stocks is actually less risky than buying the stocks outright. Of course, like all investments, there is still a risk. But this strategy is firmly at the lower-risk end of the spectrum.  
 
I teach income starved investors how to sell covered calls and cash-secured puts using the FIRE Revolution strategy. The techniques are well known to bankers, hedge funds and savvy private investors. But the specific implementation is all mine.  

Over a thirteen-week group coaching programme, we will work together to teach you the exact real-world skills you need to go from novice investor to expert stock option seller.

A raft of new legislation is making this a difficult game to win, and that’s before you even begin to worry about any new legislation a Labour government may introduce… 

I think it’s fair to say: The good times for property investors are over. 

In the last few years, the government has introduced a bunch of new regulations that have made it increasingly difficult to operate as a small landlord. Some of this is no doubt intentioned to make life better and safer for tenants — which is good — but much of it is undoubtedly designed to make life far more complicated and expensive for landlords. The message is clear — the government does not want you taking care of your own financial future through buy-to-let. 

From the additional 3% stamp duty, to the phasing out of mortgage interest tax relief, to the new HMO licensing rules, to the higher Capital Gains Tax aimed directly at second homeowners, to the plans to scrap section 21 evictions, life is getting a whole lot harder for landlords. 

Indeed, if you believe the surveys, droves of small-time landlords are just giving up the ghost and walking away. I can’t blame them.  

But why am I telling you this?  

Because there is a better way to deploy your hard-earned nest egg. 

Over the last couple of decades, I have researched, implemented, regretted, improved, and written about pretty much every source of investment going.  

And whilst I would always advocate diversifying your savings amongst different asset classes, one strategy has leapt to the front to become my weapon of choice… 

FIRE Revolution 

I call it the FIRE Revolution strategy.  

I’ve spent the last year building a programme to teach regular folks like you, how to generate repeatable income from some of the biggest and safest companies in the world. 

Although I’ve based much of it on my own years of real-world experience, the techniques covered in the programme, are well known and understood in the elite investment world. But, as with many of these things, the experts like to keep them to themselves. 

Your financial advisor will not tell you about this as there is no profit in it for him. And your bank manager is probably too busy trying to sell you their latest convoluted structured product. 

However, many financial institutions regularly use these concepts, and a certain Warren Buffett is known to love this strategy for acquiring new positions in the companies he buys. 

Indeed, as Mr. Buffett once said: 

“If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die” 

I couldn’t agree more, and that’s why I have written a 16-page report highlighting your path to financial independence, and it doesn’t involve a single buy-to-let. 

Press the LEARN MORE button to download your free copy of FIRE Revolution: The blueprint to your financial freedom.,I’ve invested in property for my whole adult life and — up until the last few years — it’s been very good to me. 

But, as I’m sure you are aware, the government has introduced a raft of new regulations that have made it increasingly difficult to operate as a small landlord. Some of this is no doubt intentioned to make life better and safer for tenants — which is good — but much of it is undoubtedly designed to make life far more complicated and expensive for landlords. The message is clear — the government does not want you taking care of your own financial future through buy-to-let. 

From the additional 3% stamp duty, to the phasing out of mortgage interest tax relief, to the new HMO licensing rules, to the higher Capital Gains Tax aimed directly at second homeowners to the plans to scrap section 21 evictions, life is getting a whole lot harder for landlords. 

And then, of course, is the sheer hassle of having to deal with building maintenance and tenants. If you choose carefully, you can still generate a low single-digit income. But, to my mind, traditional buy-to-let has had its day. The easy money has already been made 

And I for one, have had enough. I no longer have any direct property investments. It has just become way too hard to sleep at night. 

But, luckily for me, I also have a second investment string to my bow and I’d love to share it with you. 

Over the last couple of decades, I have researched, implemented, regretted, improved, and written about pretty much every source of investment going.  

And whilst I would always advocate diversifying your savings amongst different asset classes, one strategy has leaped to the front to become my weapon of choice… 

FIRE Revolution 

Brexit is taking its toll on the FTSE 100 and — by some measures — the market is trading at a twenty-year low. 

And that means that the FTSE 100 is currently stuffed full of shares yielding north of 5%, 6%, or even 7%. Pick the right ones, and the dividend payments will grow over time and outrun the damage wrought by inflation. 

Now, what if I told you there was an investment strategy that took those dividend-yielding shares and boosted the income way up into double figures. It’s a technique that is well-known amongst the financial elite and is successfully practiced by many private investors in the US and other parts of the world. But, so far, it has largely flown under the radar here in the UK. 

It takes a little time and effort to learn, but once you have mastered it, you will be well on your way to your own financial freedom. And it doesn’t involve the hassle of owning a single buy-to-let… 

Welcome to the revolution. The FIRE Revolution. 

I have written a 16-page report detailing exactly what’s involved. It’s called FIRE Revolution: The blueprint to your financial freedom' Press the LEARN MORE button to download your free copy.,With the latest raft of buy-to-let killing regulations due to hit investors in April, is it finally time to give up this once Great British investment? 

Along with the extra 3% stamp duty, the abolition of mortgage tax relief, plans to scrap section 21 evictions, and a bunch of new rules around HMOs, the already hefty Capital Gains Tax (CGT) for second homes is about to get a whole lot worse. 

As of next April, Private Residence Relief — the scheme that exempts the final 18 months of any growth in the value of a second home from CGT — is being cut. In 2020, you will only be able to claim 9 months’ worth of relief. 

And Lettings Relief is also changing. This tax break allowed accidental landlords to claim up to £40k of CGT protection, if their main residence was ever let out. From April, this will only apply if you have actually shared the property with a tenant! 

It’s clear that the government does not want you investing in property anymore. 

Now don’t get me wrong, I’ve made plenty of property investments myself over the years and I’ve done pretty well out of them. But there is no denying, it’s a boatload of hassle having to deal with tenants, building maintenance, midnight call outs, and the like. 

And all this extra government legislation, is enough to push a small landlord over the edge. Just imagine how much worse it's going to be if Labour get into power… 

So, what to do?  

If property is no longer a viable investment for income-starved Brits, where can you invest your nest-egg to generate a decent yield with relatively low-risk? 

Bank accounts are useless. With instant access accounts topping out at 1.5% and inflation running at 2.0%, you are actually losing money in real terms. That makes them a non-starter in my book. 

Or, of course, you could hand it all over to a professional. After all, that would be the sensible thing to do, wouldn’t it? 

Well yes, if you want to make someone else rich. Every layer of management that you put between yourself and your money means paying more fees and commissions. And all those small percentages soon add up. 

And of course, there are definitely no guarantees that the ‘expertise’ you are paying for is actually going to be worth anything. Just ask Neil Woodford’s clients what they think about active professional management. 

There are many other options you can consider…Peer-To-Peer lending, crowdfunding, bonds, tech shares, cryptocurrencies, and so on. Believe me, I’ve tried them all. 

But, decades of research, tens of thousands of pounds worth of training, and many false starts have led me to one specific relatively low-risk strategy that ticks all the boxes. 

And I’d like to share it with you. 

FIRE Revolution 

The strategy is called FIRE Revolution and it uses techniques well known to hedge funds, fund managers, and knowledgeable private investors overseas. But not — until now — your average UK investor. 

It is a strategy that can generate double-digit income from some of the biggest most boring blue-chip companies around.

The ongoing slow-motion car crash known as Brexit has suppressed the FTSE 100 and it’s currently trading at a level that makes it one of the cheapest developed markets in the world. And, that in turn, means that it now sports some of the highest dividend yields in the world.  

As dividend-focused investors, we are living in a golden age of sky-high dividends being paid by some of the biggest and best quality companies in the world.  

It is quite possible to build a diversified portfolio of blue-chip stocks with a dividend yield north of 5%, or even 6%, and that’s a great basis for any investor’s portfolio. But what if I told you there was a strategy you can employ that would boost that yield way up into double figures.  

Indeed, it does not rely on just one income stream. But four!  

Welcome to the revolution. The FIRE Revolution.  
 
THE FIRE REVOLUTION INCOME STRATEGY 

The FIRE Revolution strategy makes money by investing in some of the biggest and most boring companies in the world. Companies you will have come across in your everyday life such as GlaxoSmithKline, National Grid, BP, Aviva, ITV, Pfizer, Caterpillar, BP, and many more. The sort of companies that many income investors probably already own.  
 
The FIRE Revolution strategy makes money by relying on two things that are far more predictable than forecasting the future direction of a share — dividends, and the inevitable time decay of stock options.  
 
Now, if you have just seen the word “options” and tuned out, please don’t. They are as easy to trade as stocks.  You just need the helping hand of an expert to explain how.  

And — if used as I teach you — they are perfectly safe.   
 
In fact, selling options on boring blue-chip stocks is actually less risky than buying the stocks outright. Of course, like all investments, there is still a risk. But this strategy is firmly at the lower-risk end of the spectrum.  
 
I teach income starved investors how to sell covered calls and cash-secured puts using the FIRE Revolution strategy. The techniques are well known to bankers, hedge funds and savvy private investors. But the specific implementation is all mine.

A raft of new legislation is making this a difficult game to win, and that’s before you even begin to worry about any new legislation a Labour government may introduce…

I think it’s fair to say: The good times for property investors are over.

In the last few years, the government has introduced a bunch of new regulations that have made it increasingly difficult to operate as a small landlord. Some of this is no doubt intentioned to make life better and safer for tenants — which is good — but much of it is undoubtedly designed to make life far more complicated and expensive for landlords. The message is clear — the government does not want you taking care of your own financial future through buy-to-let.

From the additional 3% stamp duty, to the phasing out of mortgage interest tax relief, to the new HMO licensing rules, to the higher Capital Gains Tax aimed directly at second homeowners, to the plans to scrap section 21 evictions, life is getting a whole lot harder for landlords.

Indeed, if you believe the surveys, droves of small-time landlords are just giving up the ghost and walking away. I can’t blame them.

But why am I telling you this?

Because there is a better way to deploy your hard-earned nest egg.

Over the last couple of decades, I have researched, implemented, regretted, improved, and written about pretty much every source of investment going.

And whilst I would always advocate diversifying your savings amongst different asset classes, one strategy has leapt to the front to become my weapon of choice…

I call it the FIRE Revolution strategy.

I’ve spent the last year building a programme to teach regular folks like you, how to generate repeatable income from some of the biggest and safest companies in the world.

Although I’ve based much of it on my own years of real-world experience, the techniques covered in the programme, are well known and understood in the elite investment world. But, as with many of these things, the experts like to keep them to themselves.

Your financial advisor will not tell you about this as there is no profit in it for him. And your bank manager is probably too busy trying to sell you their latest convoluted structured product.

However, many financial institutions regularly use these concepts, and a certain Warren Buffett is known to love this strategy for acquiring new positions in the companies he buys.

Indeed, as Mr. Buffett once said:

“If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die”

I couldn’t agree more, and that’s why I have written a 16-page report highlighting your path to financial independence, and it doesn’t involve a single buy-to-let.,With the latest raft of buy-to-let killing regulations due to hit investors in April, is it finally time to give up this once Great British investment?

Along with the extra 3% stamp duty, the abolition of mortgage tax relief, plans to scrap section 21 evictions, and a bunch of new rules around HMOs, the already hefty Capital Gains Tax (CGT) for second homes is about to get a whole lot worse.

As of next April, Private Residence Relief — the scheme that exempts the final 18 months of any growth in the value of a second home from CGT — is being cut. In 2020, you will only be able to claim 9 months’ worth of relief.

And Lettings Relief is also changing. This tax break allowed accidental landlords to claim up to £40k of CGT protection, if their main residence was ever let out. From April, this will only apply if you have actually shared the property with a tenant!

It’s clear that the government does not want you investing in property anymore.

Now don’t get me wrong, I’ve made plenty of property investments myself over the years and I’ve done pretty well out of them. But there is no denying, it’s a boatload of hassle having to deal with tenants, building maintenance, midnight call outs, and the like.

And all this extra government legislation, is enough to push a small landlord over the edge. Just imagine how much worse it's going to be if Labour get into power…

So, what to do?

If property is no longer a viable investment for income-starved Brits, where can you invest your nest-egg to generate a decent yield with relatively low-risk?

Bank accounts are useless. With instant access accounts topping out at 1.5% and inflation running at 2.0%, you are actually losing money in real terms. That makes them a non-starter in my book.

Or, of course, you could hand it all over to a professional. After all, that would be the sensible thing to do, wouldn’t it?

Well yes, if you want to make someone else rich. Every layer of management that you put between yourself and your money means paying more fees and commissions. And all those small percentages soon add up.

And of course, there are definitely no guarantees that the ‘expertise’ you are paying for is actually going to be worth anything. Just ask Neil Woodford’s clients what they think about active professional management.

There are many other options you can consider…Peer-To-Peer lending, crowdfunding, bonds, tech shares, cryptocurrencies, and so on. Believe me, I’ve tried them all.

But, decades of research, tens of thousands of pounds worth of training, and many false starts have led me to one specific relatively low-risk strategy that ticks all the boxes.

And I’d like to share it with you.

The strategy is called FIRE Revolution and it uses techniques well known to hedge funds, fund managers, and knowledgeable private investors overseas. But not — until now — your average UK investor.

It is a strategy that can generate double-digit income from some of the biggest most boring blue-chip companies around.

The sort of shares that are already stuffed into pretty much every pension fund going.

Shares such as GSK, Lloyds, National Grid, Aviva, BP, and so on.

The sort of shares that pay dividends of 5%, 6%, or even higher, and that makes them great income producers in their own right.

But the FIRE Revolution strategy takes things to a whole different level. It multiplies your investment to produce four different income streams. And that’s exactly what I aim to teach savvy investors on the 13-week FIRE Revolution group training programme.

And then, of course, is the sheer hassle of having to deal with building maintenance and tenants. If you choose carefully, you can still generate a low single-digit income. But, to my mind,

traditional buy-to-let has had its day. The easy money has already been made

And I for one, have had enough. I no longer have any direct property investments. It has just become way too hard to sleep at night.

But, luckily for me, I also have a second investment string to my bow and I’d love to share it with you.

FIRE Revolution

Brexit is taking its toll on the FTSE 100 and — by some measures — the market is trading at a twenty-year low.

And that means that the FTSE 100 is currently stuffed full of shares yielding north of 5%, 6%, or even 7%. Pick the right ones, and the dividend payments will grow over time and outrun the damage wrought by inflation.

Now, what if I told you there was an investment strategy that took those dividend-yielding shares and boosted the income way up into double figures. It’s a technique that is well-known amongst the financial elite and is successfully practiced by many private investors in the US and other parts of the world. But, so far, it has largely flown under the radar here in the UK.

A raft of new legislation is making this a difficult game to win, and that’s before you even begin to worry about any new legislation a Labour government may introduce…

I think it’s fair to say: The good times for property investors are over.

In the last few years, the government has introduced a bunch of new regulations that have made it increasingly difficult to operate as a small landlord. Some of this is no doubt intentioned to make life better and safer for tenants — which is good — but much of it is undoubtedly designed to make life far more complicated and expensive for landlords. The message is clear — the government does not want you taking care of your own financial future through buy-to-let.

From the additional 3% stamp duty, to the phasing out of mortgage interest tax relief, to the new HMO licensing rules, to the higher Capital Gains Tax aimed directly at second homeowners, to the plans to scrap section 21 evictions, life is getting a whole lot harder for landlords.

Indeed, if you believe the surveys, droves of small-time landlords are just giving up the ghost and walking away. I can’t blame them.

But why am I telling you this?

Because there is a better way to deploy your hard-earned nest egg.

Over the last couple of decades, I have researched, implemented, regretted, improved, and written about pretty much every source of investment going.

And whilst I would always advocate diversifying your savings amongst different asset classes, one strategy has leapt to the front to become my weapon of choice…

I call it the FIRE Revolution strategy.

I’ve spent the last year building a programme to teach regular folks like you, how to generate repeatable income from some of the biggest and safest companies in the world.

Although I’ve based much of it on my own years of real-world experience, the techniques covered in the programme, are well known and understood in the elite investment world. But, as with many of these things, the experts like to keep them to themselves.

Your financial advisor will not tell you about this as there is no profit in it for him. And your bank manager is probably too busy trying to sell you their latest convoluted structured product.

However, many financial institutions regularly use these concepts, and a certain Warren Buffett is known to love this strategy for acquiring new positions in the companies he buys.

Indeed, as Mr. Buffett once said:

“If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die”

I couldn’t agree more, and that’s why I have written a 16-page report highlighting your path to financial independence, and it doesn’t involve a single buy-to-let.,With the latest raft of buy-to-let killing regulations due to hit investors in April, is it finally time to give up this once Great British investment?

Along with the extra 3% stamp duty, the abolition of mortgage tax relief, plans to scrap section 21 evictions, and a bunch of new rules around HMOs, the already hefty Capital Gains Tax (CGT) for second homes is about to get a whole lot worse.

As of next April, Private Residence Relief — the scheme that exempts the final 18 months of any growth in the value of a second home from CGT — is being cut. In 2020, you will only be able to claim 9 months’ worth of relief.

And Lettings Relief is also changing. This tax break allowed accidental landlords to claim up to £40k of CGT protection, if their main residence was ever let out. From April, this will only apply if you have actually shared the property with a tenant!

It’s clear that the government does not want you investing in property anymore.

Now don’t get me wrong, I’ve made plenty of property investments myself over the years and I’ve done pretty well out of them. But there is no denying, it’s a boatload of hassle having to deal with tenants, building maintenance, midnight call outs, and the like.

And all this extra government legislation, is enough to push a small landlord over the edge. Just imagine how much worse it's going to be if Labour get into power…

So, what to do?

If property is no longer a viable investment for income-starved Brits, where can you invest your nest-egg to generate a decent yield with relatively low-risk?

Bank accounts are useless. With instant access accounts topping out at 1.5% and inflation running at 2.0%, you are actually losing money in real terms. That makes them a non-starter in my book.

Or, of course, you could hand it all over to a professional. After all, that would be the sensible thing to do, wouldn’t it?

Well yes, if you want to make someone else rich. Every layer of management that you put between yourself and your money means paying more fees and commissions. And all those small percentages soon add up.

And of course, there are definitely no guarantees that the ‘expertise’ you are paying for is actually going to be worth anything. Just ask Neil Woodford’s clients what they think about active professional management.

There are many other options you can consider…Peer-To-Peer lending, crowdfunding, bonds, tech shares, cryptocurrencies, and so on. Believe me, I’ve tried them all.

But, decades of research, tens of thousands of pounds worth of training, and many false starts have led me to one specific relatively low-risk strategy that ticks all the boxes.

And I’d like to share it with you.

The strategy is called FIRE Revolution and it uses techniques well known to hedge funds, fund managers, and knowledgeable private investors overseas. But not — until now — your average UK investor.

It is a strategy that can generate double-digit income from some of the biggest most boring blue-chip companies around.

The sort of shares that are already stuffed into pretty much every pension fund going.

Shares such as GSK, Lloyds, National Grid, Aviva, BP, and so on.

The sort of shares that pay dividends of 5%, 6%, or even higher, and that makes them great income producers in their own right.

But the FIRE Revolution strategy takes things to a whole different level. It multiplies your investment to produce four different income streams. And that’s exactly what I aim to teach savvy investors on the 13-week FIRE Revolution group training programme.

And then, of course, is the sheer hassle of having to deal with building maintenance and tenants. If you choose carefully, you can still generate a low single-digit income. But, to my mind,

traditional buy-to-let has had its day. The easy money has already been made

And I for one, have had enough. I no longer have any direct property investments. It has just become way too hard to sleep at night.

But, luckily for me, I also have a second investment string to my bow and I’d love to share it with you.

Over the last couple of decades, I have researched, implemented, regretted, improved, and written about pretty much every source of investment going.

FIRE Revolution

Brexit is taking its toll on the FTSE 100 and — by some measures — the market is trading at a twenty-year low.

And that means that the FTSE 100 is currently stuffed full of shares yielding north of 5%, 6%, or even 7%. Pick the right ones, and the dividend payments will grow over time and outrun the damage wrought by inflation.

Now, what if I told you there was an investment strategy that took those dividend-yielding shares and boosted the income way up into double figures. It’s a technique that is well-known amongst the financial elite and is successfully practiced by many private investors in the US and other parts of the world. But, so far, it has largely flown under the radar here in the UK.

It takes a little time and effort to learn, but once you have mastered it, you will be well on your way to your own financial freedom. And it doesn’t involve the hassle of owning a single buy-to-let…

There is one thing you rarely (never?)  find the farming industry discussing in relation to dairy's bovine TB epidemic.
That is the failure of the bTB skin test to identify more than around 50% of infected cattle. (source: DAERA NI bTB testing)
We think they prefer to blame badgers than propose more effective cattle testing (actiphage tests) and risk revealing the full extent of bTB in dairy herds and the potential catastrophic financial implications of that.  
When cattle TB testing is a failure there is no possibility of removing bTB from dairy herds. How can there be?
So why are farming groups not discussing the blindingly obvious?  
Where badgers are killed, whatever the residual trends in dairy disease farmers argue for the association with badgers: When  bTB infected cattle recorded numbers DROP they say killing badgers works. 
When badgers are killed and bTB infected cattle recorded INCREASE they say that killing badgers is making it worse. 
We use the word recorded with emphasis, for it is hard to see how any dairy herds can be certain they are free of bTB at any given time, seeing as the bTB skin test cannot detect all infected cattle.
They produce their entirely speculative arguments to fit the data. 
This is distraction politics, not science.
Public inquiry is needed, right now. 
(all mammals can carry and potentially transmit bTB which is a cattle disease in origin and all sources of infection stem originally from bovines hence the name bovine TB. bTB can also contaminate pasture, slurry, water and even earthworms. The continual association with badgers is dishonest)

Many residents have asked that we add further to Eltham’s ‘street bulb’ population this year to bring more spring colour. 

A few locations people have suggested are:

- In front of Lemonwell (Bank facing onto Bexley Road)

- At the junction of Crown Woods Way and Bexley Road (I’ve approached BP for a donation)

- The triangular grassed area on Avery Hill Road opposite Overmead

- The junction of Middle Park Avenue and Court Road (opposite the Tarn)

- Footscray Road (between Clare Corner and Ivor Grove)

 
Low growing bulbs like Crocuses, Muscari and Snowdrops flower early giving spring colour. 

They are also a big help to pollinating insects which are dwindling in numbers.

The flowers die back before the grass is cut so don’t look untidy.
 
Please let us know if you would like to suggest other locations, can support by donations or join us on the day","Eltham’s big Bulb plant 2019","Eltham’s big Bulb plant 2019","Eltham South (Various - please see below)","lower_bound: 2000, upper_bound: 2999","lower_bound: 0, upper_bound: 99",GBP,"{""age"":""25-34"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.00074},{""age"":""18-24"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.010355},{""age"":""18-24"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.002219},{""age"":""35-44"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.003698},{""age"":""65+"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.015533},{""age"":""55-64"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.002219},{""age"":""55-64"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.018491},{""age"":""18-24"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.049556},{""age"":""45-54"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.034763},{""age"":""35-44"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.044379},{""age"":""25-34"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.04068},{""age"":""45-54"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.149408},{""age"":""65+"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.048817},{""age"":""55-64"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.08358},{""age"":""35-44"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.272189},{""age"":""25-34"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.222633},{""age"":""45-54"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.00074}","{""region"":""Unknown"",""percentage"":0.00883},{""region"":""England"",""percentage"":0.99117}",facebook,,en

رژیم ایرانفروش نوقاجاریه و پیمان ننگین ""کاسپین چای"" (خزرچای)

امروز در نشستی به نام ""کنوانسیونِ وضعیت حقوقی دریاچهٔ کاسپین"" که در شهر آکتائو در کشور نوپای قزاقستان برگزار شد، رژیم ایرانفروش روضه خوانان به شیوهٔ اسلاف خود (رژیم قجرها) پیمان ننگین دیگری را بست که نامی برازنده تر از ""پیمان کاسپین چای"" (یا ""خزرچای"" با آنکه خزر نام نادرستیست - https://goo.gl/N7wXhW) برایش نمی توان ساخت.

در هر روی، رژیم اسلامی در چند روز گذشته همواره مدعی شده است که ایران صاحب پنجاه درصد سهم در دریاچه کاسپین نبوده و یک دروغ ساخت اپوزیسیون های مخالف رژیم است و نیز این پیمان یکی از دستاوردهای مهم نظام در چهار دهه گذشته بوده است! ولی پرسش اینست که آیا این ادعای پنجاه درصدی سهم ایران حقیقت دارد و این دستاورد برای روسیه و بقای رژیم بوده است یا ملت ایران، که این نوشتار برای پاسخ به این دو پرسش تهیه شده است.

.
آیا ۵۰٪ دریاچهٔ کاسپین متعلق به ایران است؟
در سال ۱۹۱۷ و پس از انقلاب سرخ در روسیه و بپاسازی اتحاد جمهوری شوری، قراردادهای گذشته استعماری که میان قاجارها و روسیه تزاری امضا شده بود را دولت بلشویک لغو نمود، از جمله ممنوعیت کشتیرانی ایران در دریاچهٔ کاسپین که در پیمان های ننگین گلستان و ترکمانچای گنجانده و تحمیل شده بود. پس از آن چهار پیمان دوستانه نیز در سال های ۱۹۲۱، ۱۹۳۵، ۱۹۴۰ و ۱۹۵۰ میلادی میان دولت شاهنشاهی ایران و اتحاد جماهیر شوری بسته شد که به ایران حق کشتیرانی با اهتراز پرچم خود و نیز ماهیگیری تا ۱۰ مایل دریایی (۱۸.۵۲ کیلومتر خاکی) کرانه شوروی پیشین (و بالعکس) داده شد. ولی درمورد پنجاه درصد مالکیت ایران، در هیچکدام از این پیمان نامه ها اشاره ای نشده است و ادعای رژیم کاملاً درست می باشد.[[۱]] ولی مسالهٔ قابل تامل و حقیقتی که رژیم آن را آشکار نمی سازد و شوربختانه از نظر کارشناسان نیز پنهان مانده، اینست که کاسپین یک ""دریاچه"" است و در حقوق بین الملل ""ملک و آب مشاع"" و مانند ""دریا"" قابل تقسیم بندی نیست.[[۲]]  بنابرین چون کاسپین یک دریاچه است، نیازی نبوده است تا در آن پیمان ها ""مالکیت پنجاه درصدی"" ایران ذکر شود - ولی در عوض آن ""حاکمیت مشاع"" (مالکیت مشترک یا shared ownership) ایران و ""مشارکت در تصمیم گیری"" میان طرفین (ایران و شوروی) در دریاچهٔ کاسپین، در همه پیمان ها تاکید شده است.[[۳]] بگفته ای دیگر، با آنکه این مدارک تاریخی به مالکیت پنجاه درصدی ایران اشاره ای  نمی کنند (زیرا که یک دریاچه است)، ولی ""مالکیت مشترک"" و شراکت مساوی با شوروی پیشین را توجیه، تائید و ثبت می کنند و از آن روی هم می باشد که رجب ستاروویچ صفروف، رئیس 'مرکز پژوهش های ایران معاصر در مسکو' و عضو پیشین هیئت کارشناسی روسیه در مذاکرات قزاقستان[[۴]] در گفتگو با بی بی سی اعلام کرده است:[[۵]]

   ""سال ۱۹۹۶ وقتی برقراری رژیم حقوقی دریای خزر شروع شد، ما کارشناسان انتظار داشتیم که ایران طبق قرارداد سال ۱۹۲۱ و ۱۹۴۰ درخواست ۵۰ درصد حق خودش را داشته باشد. اما در جلسه اول ایران گفت که دریای خزر باید برابر تقسیم شود. یعنی هر کسی ۲۰ درصد داشته باشد.این برای ما عجیب و غریب بود که ایران چطور از حقوق خودش گذشت می کند."" 

و می افزاید:

   ""قبل از قرارداد سال ۱۹۹۶، طبق قانون ایران اجازه داشت ۵۰ درصد داشته باشد یا حداقل برای سازش با ایران درصد خوبی را کارشناسان می خواستند برای ایران پیشنهاد دهند. بعد از تقسیم‌بندی‌ها و پروژه های جدیدی که پیش آمد، برای ایران ۱۳ درصد پیشنهاد شد که ایران قبول نکرد. به همین دلیل حدود ۲۰ سال این کنوانسیون نتوانست به توافق بین کشورها برسد.""

همچنین، دریاچه بودن کاسپین در تاریخ معاصر ایران و پیش از کودتای انگلیسی-آمریکا ۵۷ یک امر شناخته شده بود، چه میان دو رژیم قاجاری و روسیه تزاری و چه میان دولت های شاهنشاهی و روسیه کمونیستی، که حتا در مدارس ایران و دروس جغرافیایی به دانش آموزان ایرانی یاد داده می شد که ""کاسپین/مازندران/خزر بزرگترین دریاچهٔ جهان"" است - و اکنون شوندی[:علتی] که رژیم اسلامی درباره اش سکوت می کند، بدان خاطرست که بایستی به ملت ایران پاسخگو باشد، که ""چرا زمانی که این کشورهای نوپای کرانه کاسپین، برای امر تقسیم بندی، دریاچه را به دریا تبدیل کردند، این رژیم کجا بود تا از آن جلوگیری و از منافع ایران دفاع کند؟ . . چرا به کشورهای نوپا در کاسپین، بدون پیگیری قانونی و شکایت به مراجع جهانی، اجازه داد تا شرکت های نفتی غربی و شرقی، منابع نفت و گاز کاسپین، که در حقیقت پنجاه درصد از آن، متعلق به ملت ایران بوده است را به تاراج برند؟"" 

بنابرین، مشکل اساسی بر سر اینست که در چهل سال گذشته، چهار کشور در کرانه های کاسپین، ایران را  بدون سرپرست و متولی و نگهبان یافته و بدون هراسی، آن ""دریاچه"" را غیررسمی مبدل به ""دریا"" و حتا ""شبه دریا""[[۶]] ساخته و درصدد تقسیم و مالکیت میان خود بر آمده اند. در نتیجه، به خاطر ندانم کاری رژیم روضه خوانان (زیرا که کار روضه خوانان، روضه خوانیست نه کشورداری[[۷]])، اکنون ایرانیان را از ""حقوق مالکیت مشاع"" خود، به هر شیوه ای که رژیم می خواهد آن را ترجمه و تفسیر و با واژه های عربی بازی کند، عاری ساخته است؛ - بویژه آنکه روسیه و قزاقستان - قزاقستان و جمهوری بادکوبه و نیز  ترکمنستان و جمهوری بادکوبه، با بستن قراردهای مرزی-دریایی میان خود، کاسپین را تقسیم و مرزهای آبی برای خود قائل شده اند، که کشتی های ایران دیگر حق و توان گذر از آن ها بدون تجاوز به آب های آن کشورها را ندارد.[[۸]] نیز، با بسته شدن این پیمان و رفع ""مالکیت مشاع"" ایران، هر گونه خطری را از دو کنسرسیوم نفتی، یکی به رهبری شرکت نفت بریتانیا (BP) و دیگری شرکت نفت روسیه (Lukoil) که در دو میدان های نفت و گاز 'چراغ' و 'گونشلی' را از سال ۱۹۹۴ تا به امروز در اختیار خود داشته و نگران آن بوده اند[[۹]] را دور می سازند.

نیز بر خلاف دروغ جواد ظریف که در اعلامیه تفسیری گفته است: ""جمهوری اسلامی ایران مقررات و مفاد مربوطه قرارداد ۱۹۲۱ میان ایران و جمهوری سوسیالیست فدراتیو روسیه و هم چنین قرارداد ۱۹۴۰ بازرگانی و بحرپیمایی میان ایران و اتحاد جماهیر سوسیالیست شوروی را یادآوری و خاطرنشان می کند""، پس از بسته شدن این پیمان، آن کشورها بر اساس ماده ۱۰۲ منشور سازمان ملل پیمان نو را ثبت خواهند کرد و این مساله موجب خواهد شد تا پیمان های پیشین فسخ و غیر قابل ارجاع شوند. البته ناگفته نماند که اگر جمهوری اسلامی، پیش از تقسیم بستر و زیر بستر دریاچه کاسپین سرنگون شود و یک نظامی ملی و ایرانی که هَم و غَمش تنها ایران و ایرانی باشد بر سرکار آید، می تواند بر اساس قوانین بین اللملی با بهره وری از اصل ۶۲ کنوانسیون وین ۱۹۶۹ در مورد حقوق پیمان ها (Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties)، با اعلام و درخواست ""تغییر اساسی وضعیت ها"" (Fundamental Change of Circumstance) این پیمان ننگین را فسخ کند.[[۱۰]] ولی این حرکت مستلزم آن است که مردم ایران، تا پیش از رسیدن به نقطهٔ قابل بازگشت، رژیم ایرانستیز روضه خوانان را سرنگون سازند.

.
""امروز نتیجه دیروز است!""
رژیم روضه خوانان بخاطر عدم اگاهی نسبت به کشورداری و نیز عدم دور اندیشی، کشورهای نوپای کرانه های کاسپین را، بویژه دو جمهوری بادکوبه و ترکمنستان را همان روز نخست اعلام استقلالشان (در ۳۰ اوت ۱۹۹۱ ترسایی)، بدون در نظر گرفتن آینده و مصالح و منافع ایران و گفتگو و دریافت تعهدات در آینده، به رسمیت شناخت و امروزی را پدید آورد که شاهدش می باشیم.[[۱۱]] بگذریم از آن که اکنون رژیم برای امر فرافکنی و دورساختن افکار ملت ایران در مورد خیانت و ایرانفروشیشان، آغاز به روضه خوانی کرده است که در پی آن بوده تا پای آمریکا، اسرائیل و ناتو را از دریاچهٔ مازندران قطع کند؛ - آنهم زمانی که آمریکائی ها و شرکت های نفتی و نظامی جمهوری بادکوبه را در دستان خود داشته و حتا بادکوبه در نشست های ناتو شرکت می جوید و ترکمنستان و قزاقستان نیز از هم پیمانان آن دو کشور بشمار می روند و غیرممکن است که آن کشورها را ترک کنند. گذشته از آن که ترکیه نیز عضو ناتو است؛ - آمریکا در عراق (بویژه در اقلیم کردستان بهمراه اسرائیل)، افغانستان و همه کشورهای خلیج فارس حضور نظامی داشته و ناوگان پنجم نیروی دریایی آن کشور درآبخوست های میشماهیگ [:جزایر بحرین] پهلو گرفته است و اسرائیل هم پیمان سعودی و امارات است! بگفته ای دیگر ایران در محاصره آمریکا و اسرائیل بوده و رژیم نوقاجاری روضه خوانان نگران حضور این کشورها در دریاچه کاسپین می باشد؟! بهر روی، برای خالی نبودن عریضه، حتا اگر فرض محال بر آن گذاشته شود که ادعای رژیم درست می باشد؛ - چه ضمانتی در اجرای آن وجود دارد؟ در صورت نقض آن، آیا ایران ِ به خاک نشانده شده، توانایی تنبیه ترکمنستان و بادکوبه، یا اسرائیل که نیرومندترین ارتش آسیای غربی است و یا آمریکای ابرقدرت شماره یک جهان را دارد؟ در هر روی، مضحکانه ترین جنبه این ادعای جمهوری اسلامی در ترساندن مردم از خطر اسرائیل اینست که سازمان موساد در سرنگونی نظام شاهنشاهی و بر سرکار آوردن رژیم خمینی نقش اساسی ایفا کرده بود[[۱۲]] و نیز در چهل سال گذشته نظام و سپاه سرکوبگر پاسداران، در پشت پرده در راستای اهداف اسرائیل و صهیونیست جهانی خدمت کرده اند و این تعزیه بازی ها و جنگ زرگری ها از سوی رژیم اسلامی تنها برای رد گم کردن فراهم شده است.[[۱۳، ۱۴، ۱۵]]

.
چرا ""کاسپین چای""؟
امروز ایران ِ یتیم و بی پناه برای حفظ و دفاع از حقوق خود در دریاچهٔ کاسپین بجز رویارویی با روسیه، با سه کشور نوپای دیگر در منطقه روبروست و شوربختانه این جریانات زمانی رخ می دهد که رژیم غوغاسالار مذهبی عاری از شعور و سواد سیاسی می باشد و ایران را به دوران قاجاریه و ورشکستگی اقتصادی، سیاسی و نظامی کشانده است. در نتیجه آن چهار کشور، بویژه روسیه که ابرقدرت شماره دو جهان بشمار می رود را در موقیعتی بسیار بالاتر و مستحکم تر از ایران قرار داده است، تا بر عکس ایران هر آنچه که بدنبالش می باشند را بدست آورند. 

بنابرین، چون ایران اسلامی در موضعی بسیار خوار و ناتوانی قرار دارد، هر گونه پیمانی که بسته می شود بر علیه مصالح و منافع کشور است. ولی اگر رژیم کنونی، یک نظامی بود که نگران مصالح و منافع ایران می بود و در چنین وضیت نابسامانی بسر می برد، آن را به زمانی موکول می ساخت که کشور و ملت در موقیعت بهتری قرار  می داشت، چه از دید اقتصادی، سیاسی و چه نظامی. ولی نقصان های اساسی که این پیمان چیست؟

۱ -  بر اساس قوانین بین اللملی اگر یک حوزهٔ آبی، دارای تعریف مشخصی نباشد که آیا دریا است یا دریاچه، بستن هر گونه پیمانی در رابطه با رژیم حقوقی آن عاری از وجهه قانونی است؛[[۱۶]]

۲ - روسیه و قزاقستان با آنکه در پیمان، از کاسپین بعنوان ""دریا"" ذکر نکرده اند ولی با زیرکی از ""دریاچه"" خواندنش نیز خودداری ورزیده اند، زیرا که دریاچه بر عکس دریا دارای حقوق بین المللی متفاوتی بوده و قابل تقسیم بندی نیست.[[۱۷]] (نیز نگا به تصویر سمت چپ) بنابرین، ایران پیش از تن دادن به هر پیمانی، می بایستی در سازمان ملل ""دریاچه"" بودن کاسپین را ثبت می کرد تا بتواند از ""حق مالکیت مشاع پنجاه درصدی"" خود دفاع کند؛

۳ - با آنکه به ادعای طرفین، این پیمان ""مربوط به رژیم حقوقی دریاچهٔ کاسپین""[[۱۸]] بوده و ""تقسیم بستر و زیر بستر"" به آینده موکول شده است(!)، ولی اینک که جمهوری اسلامی این پیمان را امضا کرده و ""تقسیم بستر و زیر بستر"" را موکول به آینده ساخته، رسماً تائید کرده است که کاسپین یک ""دریا"" است، نه ""دریاچه"". در نتیجه، این پیمان راه را برای مشروع سازی ادعاهای همسایگان ایران بویژه ترکمنستان و جمهوری بادکوبه در آینده و پایمال کردن حاکمیت ایران در جنوب کاسپین هموار ساخته است - و بدور دیده می شود که ایران حتا سهم نُه درصدی نصبیش گردد.[[۱۹]] بویژه آنکه شواهد نشان می دهد، جمهوری بادکوبه و ترکمنستان، بدون واکنش و اعتراض ایران، دو دهه است که برای خود مرز دریایی پدید آورده و منابع نفتی و گازی آن را به تاراج می برند (حتا در اوت سال ۲۰۰۱  زمانی که ایران درصدد اکتشاف نفت در میدان نفتی البرز برآمد، جمهوری بادکوبه آن را تجاوز به آب های خود خواند). از این روی، بدون هیچ گمانی با وضعیت کنونی و این پیمان ننگین، زمینهٔ تقسیم بخش جنوبی و از دست دادن حاکمیت سرزمینی-آبی ایران را بطور رسمی در آینده ای نه چندان دور فراهم ساخته است، که عملاً تجزیهٔ بخشی از ایران خواهد بود!

۳ - بر اساس اصل ۱۱، ماده ۲ این پیمان، ناوهای جنگی روسیه می توانند به بهانه وضعیت اضطراری بدون اجازه ایران یا ارائه توضیحی به آبهای ساحلی ایران وارد شوند، که در حقیقت نقض حاکمیت ملی ایران است.[[۲۰]] شگفت انگیز نیست که در متن ترجمه فارسی که رژیم در رسانه های دولتی پخش کرده است، این بخش را حذف نموده است![[۲۱]]

در هر روی، برنده اصلی این پیمان پوتین/روسیه است (که حتا می توان این پیمان را ""پوتین چای"" خواند!)، زیرا به اهداف خود دست یافته است. نخست با امضای این پیمان و دریافت ضمانت مطمئن گشته است که قزاقستان، ترکمنستان و جمهوری بادکوبه به پیمان نظامی ناتو نخواهند پیوست و در صورت نقض پیمان، آن سه کشور با رویارویی نظامی روسیه مواجه خواهند شد؛ -  و سپس روسیه از خط لوله انتقال گاز ترکمنستان به اروپا از طریق جمهوری بادکوبه جلوگیری و هر گونه خطری را از انتقال و فروش گاز خود به اروپا دفع کرده است.

.
پایان سخن
همانگونه که در بالا ذکر شد، در وهلهٔ نخست این نشست نمی بایستی برگزار و این پیمان نمی بایستی امضا می شد و اگر هم می شد، می بایستی بدون دخل و تصرف، حالت الحاقی و ادامهٔ همان پیمان های گذشته میان ایران و شوروی پیشین می بود؛[[۲۲]] - بگفته ای دیگر، بدون دست زدن به مالکیت مشاع و تصمیم گیری های مشترک، کرانه های آبی اتحاد جماهیر شورروی پیشین (۸۱.۳٪ از کرانه های دریاچه[[۲۳]]) تا فاصله ۱۰ مایلی، میان چهار کشور روسیه، قزاقستان، ترکمنستان و جمهوری بادکوبه تقسیم - و دیگر بخش های دریاچه، میان ایران (۵۰٪) و آن چهار کشور (۵۰٪) تقسیم می شد، که نشده است - و مسلماً پسامدهای وخیمی برای حاکمیت ایران درآن دریاچه را در پی خواهد داشت.

در هر روی، از رخدادن این مساله نبایستی شگفت زده شد، زیرا که رژیم اسلامی را در بیگانگان در سال ۵۷ برای همین منظور بر سرکار آوردند[[۲۴، ۲۵]] و تا ایرانستان ساختن ایران هم از پلیدی و خیانت دست نخواهد کشید. ولی، مسالهٔ دردناک و غم انگیز، واکنش ضعیف ملت ایران نسبت به پایمال شدن حقوق کشورشان و خطر تجزیه آب های کاسپین از ایران در آینده است. البته امیدست پیش از آنکه به آن نقطهٔ غیرقابل برگشت رسیم، از خواب بیدار گشته و این رژیم ایرانستیز را سرنگون و بجایش یک نظام ایرانی، بر اساس هویت ملی، ارزش ها، فرهنگ و تمدن ایرانی که پایبند به ایران ""یک ملتی و تک ملیتی"" باشد، بر سر کار آوریم - وگرنه ""نوشدارو و مرگ سهراب، نه تنها برای دریاچه کاسپین، بلکه کُل ایران خواهد بود.""

فروغ اهورایی، همواره پاسدار و نگهبان ایرانزمین و ایرانیان باد!

۱۱ - برای نمونه دو کشور ج. بادکوبه و ترکمنستان تلاش دارند تا خط مرزی دریایی ایران را به خطی که به ""آستارا-غازان-قلی"" معروف است محدود کرده و مدعی می شوند که مرز رسمی میان شوروی و ایران بوده است! ولی این ادعا هیچ جنبه قانونی ندارد، زیرا که در سال ۱۹۳۵ ""کمیساریای خلق در امور داخلی"" (NKVD) پنهانی به همه نهادهای دولتی دستور داده بود تا از این خط در نقشه های داخلی شوروی بعنوان مرز ایران و شوروی درج شوند. ولی با مخالفت دولت شاهنشاهی روبرو و مورد تائید هیچ مرجع جهانی قرار نگرفت. در نتیجه نه تنها چاپ آن در نقشه های شوروی متوقف شد، بلکه منجر به بستن امضای دوستانه ۱۳۹۵ میان دو کشور گشت. در هر روی، در همهٔ نقشه هایی که از سال ۱۹۹۲ به این سو بچاپ م یرسند. بویژه نقشه ها شرکت های نفتی، این خط به دروغ بعنوان  مرز رسمی دریایی ایران و شوروی نشان داده می شوند، تا بهره برداری از منابع کاسپین را قانونی جلوه دهند. شوربختانه ایران تا به امروز حتا یک شکایت به سازمان ملل یا دادگاه بین الملل در این رابطه با این نقشه های ارائه نداده است!

At the meeting which you held last week on various aspects of North Sea oil and devolution I suggested that I might send in the attached paper in the hope that it would serve as a starting point for any assessment the Unit may wish to carry out on the economics of Scottish Independence.

The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February 1974 Election. This will be particularly apparent of page 5 where, of course, the Ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government. I have not attempted to update any of the figures, since although there would be differences these do not seem to me to be such as to alter the argument.

As you will realise, the debate on Scottish nationalism has been founded to a surprising extent on economic arguments ad the purpose of this paper was to examine how far this was affected by North Sea Oil. The first part goes through most of the usual arguments which have been used against the Nationalists in the past with fairly convincing effect; the second part sets out the sort of economic strategy which an SNP Government might try to follow indicating both the dangers and the possibilities. 

As I said at the meeting, one can reach almost any conclusion depending upon the assumptions that are made about tariffs, a common currency, a Scottish Government’s spending priorities and its success in controlling inflation. My paper may give an SNP Government the benefit of too many doubts, but I was anxious to see whether a credible economic strategy could be put together which would appear to be more convincing in terms of solving Scotland’s traditional economic problems than the regional policies of the Unionist Governments have been up until now. I think the conclusion is that the most convincing way of taking the wind out of the SNP’s sails is by demonstrating that we now have policies which can make major in-roads into these problems.

When my paper was written it was classified “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject. I am copying it now to Leo Pliatzky, Dick Ross, Jim Hamilton, John Liverman and Stuart Scott Whyte.

------------------------

THE ECONOMICS OF NATIONALISM RE-EXAMINED

It is commonplace that the discovery of North Sea oil and entry to the EEC are factors of major economic significance for Scotland.

Already both issues, especially the former, feature widely in the SNP’s election material. The purpose of this paper is to reassess the economic arguments for an independent Scotland in the light of these developments, especially the discovery of oil. It will be shown that the whole framework within which the economic implications of nationalism were argued has indeed been altered. The importance of this is probably greater than is recognised at present by the majority of the public and it may well be, therefore, that the discovery of North Sea oil will come to be seen as something of a watershed in Scotland’s economic and political life.

The case for Scottish nationalism is, of course, very much more than an economic issue. This paper makes no attempt to examine the wider questions. Suffice it to say that Scottish nationalism has been much more concerned with economic prosperity than nationalist movements in other countries. Unlike Wales there is no great cultural movement attaching to the preservation of a language.

The main cause of discontent is the country’s unsatisfactory economic performance over the last half century, especially the persistent unemployment and net emigration above all in the West of Scotland.

Poor social and environmental conditions, especially in and around the city of Glasgow, accompany this outdated economic framework and are as much a source discontent.

Despite regional policy and the efforts of planners, these problems have not been overcome, nor do they look as if they will be in the foreseeable future. The SNP have therefore based their campaign on the assertion that Scotland would be economically better off independent; and it is for this reason that budgetary estimates have always featured so large in the controversy. Yet in spite of Scotland’s undoubtedly poor economic performance the SNP case until recently lack credibility. Most people regarded both their statistics and arguments suspect, and they continued to believe that Scotland derived more economic advantage than disadvantage from the Union.

The importance of North Sea oil is that it raises just this issue in a more acute form than at any other time since the Act of Union was passed.

The Case Against Nationalism

The traditional economic case against nationalism has always been that a politically independent Scotland would be unable to gain sufficient economic sovereignty to solve her problems successfully.

This is partly a question of the scale of the Scottish economy, but more of the extent to which it has become integrated with that of the rest of the UK over the last 270 years.

Scotland needs a faster rate of economic growth than either she or the UK has had in recent years if she is to absorb her excess labour resources and thereby cut down both unemployment and migration.

There are three principal ways in which an independent Government might seek to bring this about. First it could seek to foster and protect Scottish industry by means of tariffs and import controls. But such measures would risk retaliation from England which, given Scotland’s close trade ties with England, could cause damage far in excess of any benefit that may be hoped for. Such policies would also be incompatible with continued membership of the EEC and withdrawal, especially with England, Wales and Ireland remaining members, would clearly have very damaging consequences.

Secondly, fiscal policies might be used to give especially large benefits to new industrial investment or tax relief and subsidies to existing industry. This might involve the imposition of a tax frontier at the border, as still exists between most EEC countries, but this need not to make it impractical. Such policies have been used with considerable success by the Irish Republic since the mid-1950s. The main disadvantage is that England would probably feel obliged to match the Scottish measures with equivalent in grants or tax allowances for industry in English and Welsh Development Areas. 
Up to now England has always been in a position financially where, if she wished, she could have more than matched any measures which a Scottish Government would be able to afford.

It is here that the budgetary position of a Scottish Government becomes important. Various studies, notably the Treasury’s Scottish Budget of 1967/68 and the work of the Kilbrandon Commission have shown that public expenditure per head in Scotland is generally above the UK average, whereas public revenue is Scotland is slightly lower, largely because Scottish incomes are below the UK average. 

The result is that budgetary estimates for Scotland show a proportionately larger borrowing requirement than for the UK as a whole. His position is confirmed in the most recent estimate of Scotland’s budgetary position carried out by the Economic and Statistics Unit of SEPD for 1971/72. This shows a Scottish current account surplus of £24m. but a net borrowing requirement of £447m. overall.

There are, of course, various ways in which this could be tackled. In the first place it is not necessary to balance the budget. To finance loans and various items of capital investment, particularly those which yield a return by borrowing is quite reasonable; other items too may be covered by borrowing from time to time particularly if an expansionary budget is necessary to generate a higher level of economic activity in the economy. For these various reasons the United Kingdom budget normally involves a net borrowing requirement and whilst this will normally be fairly small this is not always so; in the present year, for example, the borrowing requirement reached the record figure of £4,000m.

If allowance is made for the capital items that it would normally be reasonable to finance by loan, this would still lave a Scottish deficit of over £200m., a very similar figure in 1971/72 to what it was in 1967/68. Whilst such a figure could be covered if it arose only exceptionally, it could not be tolerated as a regular feature of the budget. It would involve a steadily increasing Scottish debt and it would have serious implications both for interest rates and monetary policy, unless a substantial part of it could be financed from abroad. 

A Scottish Government would therefore have to take steps to reduce the deficit either by raising taxes or cutting expenditure. Such measures are perfectly possible, and on the scale necessary, need not provoke a intolerable situation, especially if defence was one of the items cut; but they would create a background of acute budgetary stringency against which it is hard to see it being possible to provide a major fiscal stimulus to encourage economic expansion.

The third possible course of action would be to devalue the Scottish currency. This would stimulate economic activity by increasing the demand for exports and making Scottish goods more competitive against imports in their home market. In many respects devaluation would be the obvious measure for an economy in Scotland’s condition with persistent unemployment, a budgetary deficit and probably a serious adverse balance on the balance of payments.

Indeed, if the later was persistent, it might be that devaluation would be inescapable.

Exchange rate adjustment is, of course, the ultimate and most effective weapon by which an economically sovereign state maintains approximately full employment while at the same time avoiding balance of payments disequilibrium. Indeed, if Scotland could have devalued by a good thumping 2 percent and made the adjustment effective in terms of costs, this would be by far the best way of solving Scotland’s economic problems of the last two decades. It has been argued that the ‘regional problem’ only arises because exchange rate adjustment, the normal way of dealing with disequilibria between countries, is not possible between regions.

However, the economic case against Scottish nationalism has always at bottom come down to the proposition that an independent Scotland would not find it possible to carry out an effective devaluation.

To be effective, devaluation involves a country in making a cut in its real living standards at least until such time as production is able to catch up. But the Scottish labour market is so closely linked with that of the rest of the UK that it is hard to see how real earnings could be adjusted downwards without giving rise to the most serious difficulties.

For such a small country heavily dependent of international trade, devaluation would, of course, have serious inflationary consequences, since all imports would rise in price. Trade Unions are to a large extent on a Great Britain basis and it is hard to see them accepting a deliberate attempt to cut real wages in Scotland compared with England whatever the reason for it may be. Furthermore, even with independence, freedom of labour movement between England and Scotland would be likely to continue, a common language and two and a half centuries of free movement make this easy. Changes in real wage levels would therefore be likely to be reflected in migration figures and could lead to a shortage of certain types of skilled labour in Scotland even while a surplus among the less mobile unskilled persisted.

It is for these reasons that many economists have in the past concluded that Scotland, if she were independent, would probably be unable to devalue effectively against the rest of the United Kingdom.

Lacking this ultimate weapon of economic sovereignty and limited by the budgetary situation in the use she could make of fiscal policy, it did not seem that political independence would give Scotland sufficient economic sovereignty to enable her to tackle her economic problems successfully, At the same time, whatever the constitutional set-up, the Scottish economy would remain closely integrated with that of the rest of the UK and would be greatly affected by policy decisions taken in London, though as an independent state her ability to influence those decisions would be greatly reduced.

The Implications of North Sea Oil

The analysis in the last section is based on the situation as it appeared before the discovery of North Sea oil. Even after its discovery the full significance of North Sea oil was not immediately apparent and it still remains in large measure disguised from the Scottish public by the DTI’s failure to make provision for a proper Government return when the fourth round of licences was issued.

So far all that Ministers have said is that they expect North Sea oil to be yielding 70-100m. tons of oil per annum by 1980 and that on that basis the Government revenue from rent and royalties from the whole of the Continental Shelf including the gas fields in the southern sector may be of the order of £100m. per annum at that time. It has been explained that this estimate does not include the yield from ordinary taxation on the oil companies and it has been stated that licensing policy is currently under review but the significance of this has probably not been fully appreciated by the public.

The SNP countered these figures by claiming that North Sea oil should by 1980 be yielding a Government revenue of approximately £800m. and have charged the Government with giving Scottish oil away to the international companies ridiculously cheap. Up to now much of the Scottish public may have regarded the SNP figures as pretty wild and they have been publicly condemned as such by Ministers.

But authoritative support for the charge that the Government has failed to do a satisfactory bargain with the companies is provided in the criticisms of the Public Accounts Committee which so far remain unanswered. The example of Norwegian policy on Government revenue from oil likewise shows up the failure of British.

The Government’s reveiw of licensing policy has been in progress since the early summer of 1973. This has confirmed the total inadequacy of arrangements to secure Government revenue and shows that some of the most attractive measures to put this right would involve breaking the terms on which the licences were given. It is partly for this reason that the Government has so far failed to take a decision, the choice lying between carried interest (ie state participation), which would provide the biggest revenue and also give some power of control but would go back on the terms of the licences, and excess revenue tax, from which the return in 1980 would be some £200m. less but would be defensible in international law.

The DTI estimates of last summer showed that total Government revenue following adoption of these measures would have been between £800m. and £1,200m. a year in 1980 depending on the system used and the prices prevailing in 1980; today, following the huge increase in international oil prices of recent months the corresponding figures are in the range of £1,500m. to over £3,000m. Thus, all that is wrong now with the SNP estimate is that it is far too low; there is a prospect of Government oil revenues in 1980 which could greatly exceed the present Government revenue in Scotland from all sources and could even be comparable in size to the whole of the Scottish national income in 1970.

As well as the gain to the Government Revenue, North Sea oil will of course make a massive contribution to the balance of payments; indeed these two aspects are closely linked. At present world prices the expected output of 100m. tons of oil in 1980 is worth approximately £3,000m.; assuming price rises from the present £33 a ton to £51 a ton as in the Government revenue calculations the value could be as high as $5,000m. Part of this will, of course, be repatriated by the international companies in the form of profits distributed to their shareholders or reinvested in projects in other areas. 

The balance of payments gain to Scotland would therefore depend critically on the amount of Government revenue secured from the profits. Indeed, since none of the major companies operating in the North Sea are predominantly Scottish owned, the Government revenue would be the major element, apart from the expenditure of the companies on goods and services produced in Scotland, which would accrue from the value of oil produced as a balance of payments gain. 

Thus assuming measures which would yield Government revenue of the scale referred to in previous paragraphs, plus some additional revenue to shareholders in Scotland and to suppliers of equipment, then the net balance of payments gain might be expected to lie very approximately in the range of £2,000m. to £3,500m. a year, depending on prices and the share of the Government ‘take’.

It is not possible to compare these figures with an accurate estimate of Scotland’s present balance of payments position. From the state of Scotland’s economy one would expect a balance of payments deficit on current account and a rough comparison of income and expenditure estimates for GDP suggest that this could be of the order of £300m. a year in 1970/71.

Plainly this is a most unreliable figure and it will vary from year to year, but it is probably sufficient to suggest the orders of magnitude.

What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.

All the above figures are, of course, based on the estimated output of 100m. tons of oil in 1980. This was the DTI’s revised estimate in the early summer of 1973.

Already it is beginning to look as if these estimates may be too conservative. Recent finds and the plans of companies appear to indicate that the Shetland basin may prove very productive indeed. Zetland County Council’s consultants worked on the assumption that 70m. tons a year might actually be piped ashore in the county. It is now known that Shell expect to land 50m. tons a year through their own pipe alone and pipelines may also be expected from Total’s Alwyn field, Conoco’s Hutton and the recent BP and Burmah finds. In addition to this there are, of course, substantial finds further south, particularly BP’s Forties field and Occidental’s Piner. Whether or not this, plus any new finds that are made, result in the 1980 estimate of 100m. tons being exceeded largely depends on how quickly newly discovered fields are brought into production, but it does now seem extremely likely that production during the 1980s will use well above 100m. tons a year with consequent increases in revenue and gain to the balance of payments.

Can one be certain that the oil is without doubt a Scottish asset or, even if it is, that these substantial revenues and balance of payments advantages would indeed accrue to an independent Scotland? Clearly these questions raise complicated issues in international law which could, if allowed, occupy the legal profession for many years. Two possible lines of argument may be expected: either that Scotland should pay England some compensation for appropriating the most productive part of the Continental Shelf, or that the whole shelf should be regarded as the common property of the nations of the former United Kingdom with revenue distributed in accordance with some population based formula irrespective of where oil is discovered. 

As regards the first of the arguments, the prospective return from oil revenue would at the very least be one of the factors taken into account in determining the financial settlement between the two countries when they become independent. To argue the second would be directly counter to the line that the UK Government has taken with the EEC, that the resources of the Continental Shelf are as much a national asset as are those on land, like coal mines, and that there is therefore no question of the Europeanisation of North Sea oil.

Disputes on these matters might well occasion much bitterness between the two countries, but it is hard to see any conclusion other than to allow Scotland to have that part of the Continental Shelf which would have been hers if she had been independent all along.

There might be some argument about where the boundary between English and Scottish waters would lie. At present this is considered to be along the line of latitude which lies just north of Berwick on Tweed, and it might perhaps be held that it should run NE/SW as an extension of the Border. This could have the effect of transferring the small oilfields in the south, Auk and Argyll, to the English sector, but would not affect the main finds.

It must be concluded therefore that large revenues and balance of payments gains would indeed accrue to a Scottish Government in the event of independence provided that steps were taken either by carried interest or by taxation to secure the Government ‘take’. Undoubtedly this would banish any anxieties the Government might have had about its budgetary position or its balance of payments. The country would tend to be in chronic surplus to a quite embarrassing degree and its currency would become the hardest in Europe, with the exception perhaps of the Norwegian kroner. Just as deposed monarchs and African leaders have in the past used the Swiss franc as a haven of security, so now would the Scottish pound be seen as a good hedge against inflation and devaluation and the Scottish banks could expect to find themselves inundated with a speculative inflow of foreign funds.

II A Policy for Development

The situation described in the first part of this paper is indeed an astounding reversal of the problems which are usually considered in a Scottish or British context. But it could nonetheless give rise to some serious difficulties and would require careful handling if Scotland was really to derive maximum benefit from it. It is, of course, perfectly possible that these difficulties would not be overcome and that an independent Scotland despite its wealth would continue to have an unsatisfactory economic performance. It takes more than money to eliminate the traditional problems of the Scottish economy and nationalist movements, dependent as they are on strong emotional pressures, have not always been notable for their economic realism. In this respect the example of Ireland’s poor economic performance between 1922 and 1956 comes immediately to mind and the SNP is already showing signs of making promises which could be an embarrassment to its economic management.

Nevertheless it is obvious that the surpluses from North Sea oil would open up new opportunities for a nationalist Government. The purpose of this second part of the paper is therefore to consider in very brief outline some of the policies a nationalist Government could follow to try to bring about the development and prosperity of the country as a whole.

Scotland’s central economic problem is to secure a faster rate of economic growth so that she can raise income levels and absorb the excess labour which presently appears as high unemployment and emigration. As has been explained, this is a situation which would normally point to devaluation as a possible remedy. North Sea oil, however, by giving the country a chronic balance of payments surplus, would rule out any possibility of devaluation. Indeed, it is hard to see how an upward valuation of the currency could be avoided. Obviously this pressure should be resisted as far as possible; but unless there was a remarkable change in the strength of sterling, it must be expected that the Scots pound would rise in relation to it fairly soon after independence, especially if the latter continues its downward slide. A revaluation would give rise to none of the difficulties which were argued earlier to apply to a Scottish devaluation.

Since the effect would be to reduce prices and raise incomes there would not be the same resistance to making it effective in Scotland. An exchange rate of £1 Scots to 120p sterling within two years of independence therefore seems quite probable.

This exchange rate movement would improve Scottish real incomes; imports would all become cheaper, and GDP per head in Scotland, which would include the value of the oil produced, would rise smartly. The gap between Scottish income per head and English would probably soon be eliminated and might well be reversed. The danger is that with a rising currency Scotland’s traditional economy would find it more and more difficult to compete; manufactured exports would be priced out of foreign markets and imports would become highly competitive at home; tourists would find that the rate of exchange made Scotland a very expensive country for holidays; and Scottish farmers would find that the EEC’s Common Agricultural Policy gave them a much less satisfactory level of support than expected. Thus there would be grave risk that the economy would be driven more and more to depend on the oil industry and other activities would tend to wither.

But while oil would give Scotland a good income, it could never be an adequate source of employment with the rest of the economy in decline.

Scotland, therefore, could face the danger of prosperity coupled with continuing or even worsening unemployment and emigration.

To counteract this situation it would be essential to try to keep the surpluses on the balance of payments down and thereby reduce the upward pressure on the exchange rate. This could involve extensive lending abroad, whether to England, the EEC or under-developed countries. Such lending could well be in Scotland’s interest rather than face the prospect of an intolerably high exchange rate; it might also do much to help cement relations with other EEC countries and, coupled with the supplies of oil for export, would make Scotland a highly desirable member of EEC with a strong bargaining position.

The first priority, however, would be to spend the surpluses as far as possible in developing Scotland’s domestic economy and providing a modern infrastructure. The following paragraphs suggest how this might be done.

a. Manufacturing Industry

Output per head in most sectors of Scottish industry is well below European levels. This is largely because the British economy has invested much less than other European countries over the last 25 years. A substantial increase in manufacturing investment is therefore necessary if this is to be put right. Only then will Scottish industry be able to compete effectively with other members of EEC at anything other than low exchange rates.

Part of the reason for the low investment in Scotland in the past has been the persistence of ‘stop-go’ in the UK economy. Every time investment has begun to rise satisfactorily, as it was doing in 1973, the emergence of a balance of payments deficit has forced the Government to take strong deflationary measures with the result that the investment boom has petered out again. Scotland made good progress in 1973, but ideally from her point of view the 5 per cent growth rate needed to go on for another couple of years. As an independent state, Scotland’s balance of payments position would enable her to break out of the ‘stop-go’ cycle and a sustained rate of growth could be planned on the basis that it could be carried on for at least a decade.

The strength of the currency coupled with the budgetary surplus would help to keep interest rates down and there would be no need for sudden increases in taxation or massive cuts in public expenditure.

Admittedly, since Scotland is so closely tied to the English market, her economy would continue to be affected by measures taken in London, but this effect would diminish the more Scotland expands trade with other EEC countries. Furthermore, it would be quite proper for a Scottish Government to take countervailing measures to stimulate the Scottish economy at times when England was going through a recession.

Such measures would help to keep Scottish output up and would help the English economy by reducing the Scottish balance of payments surplus. It can be expected therefore that the prospect of sustained expansion and an end to ‘stop-go’ would do more than anything else could both to raise investment in domestic industry and to encourage foreign investment to come to Scotland.

However, this expansionary macroeconomic policy would need to be backed up by firm regional policy measures. The position in West Central Scotland has deteriorated vis-a-vis the rest of Scotland over the last decade and this is likely to be even more accentuated by North Sea oil developments.

Furthermore, as an independent state, it would seem to be quite inappropriate for Scotland to regard the whole of the territory as subject for regional policy. Something along the lines of the following package of measures therefore seems to be most appropriate:

i. For Scotland as a whole the Regional Development Grant would be abolished, but to stimulate investment Corporation Tax would either be abolished or reduced to a purely nominal rate. This would have the effect of more or less removing the tax from industry’s retained profits while leaving distributed profits taxed roughly as they are at present. As a national fiscal policy measure it would not come within the control of the EEC’s ceilings on regional aids. The cost of abolishing Corporation Tax would be £120m.

ii. West Central Scotland would be scheduled as Scotland’s Development Area and the definition could be extended to certain smaller areas in the Highlands and Islands if necessary. Within this area there would be a 20 per cent Regional Development Grant paid as at present in addition to (i) above.

iii. There would be a Scottish Development Authority covering the whole of Scotland but with instructions to give particular priority to West Central Scotland.

Its budget would at least be on a scale equivalent to the funds which previously went into REP and SIDO. It would be empowered to give discretionary grants and loans and would be equipped to provide advice to companies. It would be responsible for working out a strategy for developing Scotland’s domestic industry as well as promoting foreign investment. The HIDB would continue to operate with its own much wider remit in the Highlands.

iv. Steps would be taken to strengthen the shipbuilding industry by adopting a scheme for insurance against inflationary risk as operated in France and approved by EEC. The new SDA would be especially charged with the preparation of proposals for the modernisation of the industry.

b. Construction

The construction industry employs a substantial part of the labour force and its fluctuations have been a major factor in unemployment. In 1971 no less than 25,000 of the 100,000 unemployed were registered as construction workers.

In times of boom the shortage of skilled labour in the industry becomes a serious bottleneck in the economy although coupled with continuing large numbers of unskilled unemployment.

The industry does not play as large a part in the British economy as in most other European countries and this coupled with the manifest need for urban rebuilding and house replacement suggest that, with the proper policy, the industry could play a much larger part in providing steady employment for the Scottish labour force. Indeed, if the Scottish construction industry employed 10 per cent of the labour force, the EEC average, this would mean employment for an additional 40 thousand.

With North Sea oil revenues, public expenditure on construction projects could be greatly stepped up and a major operation should be mounted to carry on the rebuilding of Glasgow and do much more than has been done in the past for environmental recovery. This would probably require a special Environmental Recovery Agency to assist the local authorities rather in the way that SSHA operates.

Housing policy has been bedevilled in the past by the subsidisation of certain types of housing. This has led to the colossal public housing sector in Scotland with the emphasis on quantity rather than quality. It seems desirable to subsidise housing for many years to come both to improve the living conditions of the Scottish people and to keep up the demand on the construction industry. Instead of subsidising rents at one extreme and at the other giving tax relief on mortgages which is greater the larger the mortgage, it would seem much more appropriate to give the assistance to individuals regardless of the type of house they occupy or whether they are tenants or owners.

This could probably be done under the new tax credit system and it would have the effect of providing a housing subsidy or negative tax to those with low incomes and a housing tax allowance to others. In this way demand for housing as a whole could be encouraged while avoiding the distortion between different types of housing which has been such a feature of the past. It would be likely that local authority housing would then gradually decline in importance and housing associations would assume greater prominence. As competition between different forms of housing increased, so the quality of housing would improve.

c. Service Industry

In the past service industry has received much less assistance from regional policy than manufacturing.

In part this is right because many service activities, such as medical services, education, accountants, distribution, are governed simply by local demand. But there are service activities, notably major offices, which have a choice of location and every effort should be made to attract them to areas where labour is available.

Following independence the increased Government activity would largely wipe out any spare labour resources in Edinburgh, but major efforts would be needed to promote commercial and office development in Glasgow. The Scottish Development Authority should be empowered to offer assistance, comparable in scale to that available to manufacturing industry, to encourage such development in the Glasgow conurbation and the system of property rating should be revised, if not abolished, to prevent high rates being a brake on commercial development as they have been in the past.

Tourist development would obviously assume major importance for any independent Scotland and the financial resources available to the Tourist Board could be increased.

d. The Pace of North Sea Oil Development

On the face of it the pace of development of North Sea oil appropriate for Scotland would be very different from that now being demanded by the UK.

Apart from the need to avoid piling up excessive surpluses, Scotland would wish to extend her North Sea oil revenue over a much longer period than the 30 or so years which seems likely at presently planned rates of extraction. It is also desirable to avoid the frenzied peaks of activity which seem likely in Shetland, the Moray Firth and Loch Carron on present plans.

These will impose immense infrastructure demands, lead to a substantial inflow of population and leave in their wake problems of readjustment and unemployment which it may take years of regional policy to overcome. In addition the contribution of Scottish Industry to oil developments, which is so far disappointing, might be increased substantially if the whole programme is not required to go at the maximum possible speed.

From a purely Scottish point of view this suggests that a production flow of, say, 50m. tons a year might be ideal.

Even this would be five times Scotland’s present consumption and yield and annual revenue of between £700m and £1,500m.

However one cannot look at the Scottish position in isolation.

If, because of action in the Middle East, there is a serious energy shortage in Europe, Scotland would undoubtedly suffer severely from the resulting slump. It would therefore be in Scotland’s interests to increase her oil production well beyond what would otherwise seem desirable. If however there is no serious shortage in physical terms, merely a crisis of price, then action by Scotland is not going to affect the international price of oil, nor will it matter to the other countries what the source of their oil is.

e. Inflation, Income Policy and Training

The strength of the Scottish exchange rate and the low interest rates which would result from the budgetary and balance of payments position would do much to reduce inflationary pressure. A major part of the British inflation has resulted from the downward drift of the currency and the consequent rise in import prices. The absence of this, relaxations in taxation and subsidies for housing would no doubt help to reduce the pressure of wage increases.

Nevertheless as Scotland moved nearer full employment serious shortages of certain types of skilled labour would occur and this would tend to produce acute inflationary pressure.

Some form of incomes policy is clearly going to be a continuing feature of advanced economies and would be essential in Scotland if the economy was not to price itself out of international markets. It is important to recognise, however, that the labour shortages which give rise to the pressure could be avoided to a considerable degree if training schemes were more flexible and if a substantial increased effort was put into retraining. A full-scale examination of training is clearly an early priority.

The European Community Membership of the EEC affects the economics of Scottish independence in several important respects. It guarantees access to English and Continental markets in a way which would not be possible otherwise. Without EEC Scotland would always run the risk that England might find it expedient to impose an import surcharge, a quantitative control or even a tariff on goods coming from Scotland. It was largely to eliminate this that Scotland accepted the Union of 1707. New EEC rules would have the same effect and for all nine member states. In the unlikely event of England leaving the EEC, Scottish access to the other countries could in time largely compensate for any restrictions that might arise on English trade.

Access to EEC should also help to provide a major stimulus to Scottish industrial investment. The EEC is not only a bigger market than the UK but its economy has been much more buoyant than that of Britain. There is no doubt that the exclusion of the United Kingdom had a damaging effect on investment and that foreign firms in particular preferred development within EEC. To gain the full advantage of this stimulus from membership it will, of course, be necessary to have a stable domestic economy.

High rates of inflation and a declining currency such as the UK has had recently would do much to discourage foreign companies from coming to Scotland.

North Sea oil could have far-reaching consequences for Scottish membership of EEC because of the tremendously increased political power it would confer. Without oil other members might pay little enough regard to Scotland; her voting power would not be large and it might indeed be argued that she could exert more leverage on the Community as part of the United Kingdom. As the major producer of oil in Western Europe, however, Scotland would be in a key position and other countries would be extremely foolish if they did not seek to do all they could to accommodate Scottish interests. For Scotland the net cost of Common Agricultural Policy, which features so large in British discussions would be at most some £40m. a year, a small sum compared with the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil. The more common policies come to be decided in Brussels in the years ahead, the more Scotland would benefit from having her own Commissioner in the EEC as of right and her own voice in the Council of Ministers instead of relying on the indirect, and so far hardly satisfactory, form of vicarious representation through UK departments.

Conclusion This paper has shown that the advent of North Sea oil has completely overturned the traditional economic arguments used against Scottish nationalism. An independent Scotland could now expect to have massive surpluses both on its budget and on its balance of payments and with the proper husbanding of resources this situation could last for a very long time into the future.

Wealth does not automatically mean full employment and the end of net emigration. But provided sensible policies are pursued, it is possible to see how this situation could be used to re-equip Scottish industry and renew outworn social capital thereby providing the expansion necessary to absorb Scotland’s excess labour and the increase in productivity required to raise incomes. Thus, for the first time since the Act of Union was passed, it can now be credibly argued that Scotland’s economic advantage lies in its repeal. When this situation comes to be fully appreciated in the years ahead, it is likely to have a major impact on Scottish politics, since it is on social and political grounds alone that the case for retention of the union will in future have to be based.

Nationalist policy as outlined in this paper can, of course, be regarded as extremely selfish.

Undoubtedly it is, but it can be argued in reply that so long as Scottish GDP per head is only 70 per cent of the European average, the unemployment and emigration rates among the highest and the country regarded by the EEC as one of its worst problem regions, then Scotland is justified in using her own resources to rectify these problems rather than relying on the generosity of others at least until she has managed to catch up.

Yet undoubtedly the greatest weakness in the nationalist economic case is that Scotland, even with its oil, cannot expect to prosper in isolation.

Economic conditions in Europe and above all in England, with whom Scotland will remain closely tied in trade, are of particular importance. Even with greater diversification of Scottish trade to Europe and to North America, an impoverished England or one perpetually suffering the rigours of demand restraint would have most serious consequences for the Scottish economy. Britain is now counting so heavily on North Sea oil to redress its balance of payments that it is easy to imagine England in dire straits without it. The oil prices since the Yom Kippur war make this a much more serious matter than could have been imagined before; and it is now likely that transfer of North Sea oil to Scottish ownership would occasion much bitterness in England if not an attempt to forcibly prevent it. England would, of course, be no worse off than most of the Continental EEC countries in this respect; indeed, probably there are better chances of finding oil in the Celtic Sea or the English Channel than are open to most of them. If therefore the other countries can adjust to the new energy situation, England should be able as well.

Nevertheless it is now clear, as perhaps never before, that Europe could bring about its economic ruin by disunity. If supplies of oil become seriously restricted or the burden on the balance of payments of importing countries proves more than the international monetary system can cope with, a serious breakdown in the economic system of Western Europe could well result.

This danger imposes serious international responsibilities on those European countries which are likely to be exporters of energy, Norway, Scotland if independent, and Ireland where oil is likely to be discovered. A spirit of European co-operation is not very evident yet either in discussions or plans for the development of energy and the rather nationalistic attitude so far followed by Britain would hardly be a good example to an independent Scotland. Yet the situation offers the energy producers a real opportunity to contribute to the economic strength of Europe and in so doing to ensure their own prosperity; if instead they retreat into narrow nationalism, developing their energy resources with regard to their own interests alone, they could undermine the whole European economy and seal their own fate in the process.

Perhaps the most important conclusion is that time is now extremely limited. British regional policy has been in operation for forty years and the annual cost of the measures applied to Scotland is now about £100m. a year. But, although there have been undoubtedly been notable achievements and the Scottish economy would have been in a much worse state without such a policy, there is still little prospect that it will solve the problems of West Central Scotland in the foreseeable future. High hopes have been held out for European regional policy but any impact from this is likely to be very small for a long time to come. In much the same way agitation for a workable form of political devolution has persisted amongst a substantial part of the Scottish electorate for a considerable time but without any practical result so far and it is still far from clear whether anything will stem from the consideration of the Kilbrandon Report.

If, in five years’ time North Sea oil is contributing massively to the UK budget, while the economic and social condition of West Central Scotland continues in the poor state that it is today, it would be hard to imagine conditions more favourable to the growth of support for the nationalist movement.

Very determined steps to urgently transform economic conditions in Scotland will therefore be necessary and the Scottish people will have to be persuaded that their problems really have received the attention and expenditure they deserve if this outcome is to be avoided.","This is what Westminster doesn't want you to read: The McCrone Report in full",thenational.scot,"IMPORTANT: We are lowering the paywall on our site for our coverage of the McCrone Report today.
