Near Houston, we’re planning to build the world’s largest low-carbon hydrogen facility at our integrated Baytown complex. More than 98% of the associated CO₂ produced by the facility, or around 7 million metric tons per year, is expected to be captured and permanently stored. 

We’ve also agreed to transport and store CO₂ to reduce emissions from Linde plc’s new hydrogen facility in Beaumont, TX; CF Industries’ manufacturing site in Donaldsonville, LA; and Nucor ’s direct reduced iron facility in Convent, LA. 

With these three agreements, the total CO₂ we’ve agreed to transport and store for third-party customers has reached 5 million metric tons per year. That’s equivalent to replacing approximately 2 million gasoline-powered cars with electric vehicles, which is roughly equal to the total number of EVs on US roads today.

"“The energy transition is a global challenge – it’s not one size fits all.”

Those are the words of Matt Crocker, senior vice president for our Low Carbon Solutions business, at a recent Houston Asia Society event, where he shared our plan to help accelerate the world’s path to net zero emissions. We’re starting with the technologies that match our strengths -- carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and biofuels.

We have agreements in place to transport and store up to 5 million metric tons of CO₂ a year for three of our customers along the U.S. Gulf Coast. That’s equivalent to replacing approximately 2 million gasoline-powered cars with electric vehicles, which is roughly equal to the total number of EVs on US roads today. We’re also planning to build the world’s largest low-carbon hydrogen plant in Baytown, Texas, at planned start up.

We plan to invest $17 billion through 2027 on lower-emission initiatives. 

Matt shared the stage with Takajiro “Tak” Ishikawa, president and CEO of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) America. ExxonMobil and MHI have a strategic alliance on #carboncapture technology. 

They discussed the value of working with start-ups on cutting-edge technology, the need for creative solutions in countries that lack geologic formations for CO₂ storage, and the growing demand from industries seeking help to reduce their emissions. 

The panel also included Charles McConnell, executive director of carbon management and energy sustainability at the University of Houston and Uday Turaga, CEO of ADI Analytics.

"Diversify. That’s the typical advice you get from a financial advisor. 

But that’s also the advice we’d give you to ensure energy security. 

Why? It’s a strong defense against:

🚢 supply disruption 
🛍️ volatility caused by geo-political turmoil
💰 higher energy cost

In order to maintain energy security without increasing global emissions, energy diversification should be a priority for nations worldwide. That’s the message from our very own Peter Clarke, senior VP of global LNG, when he spoke at Gastech Exhibition & Conference in Singapore earlier this month.  

At ExxonMobil, we offer diverse, flexible, reliable and lower-carbon LNG from our global portfolio. Diversification is what we deliver.

"We’re accelerating our Upstream Portfolio.

Today, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Pioneer, a large oil and gas exploration company with more than 850,000 net acres in the Midland Basin.

The acquisition of Pioneer transforms ExxonMobil’s upstream portfolio, more than doubling the company’s Permian footprint and creating an industry-leading, high-quality, high-return undeveloped U.S. unconventional inventory position.

This merger represents the opportunity for even greater U.S. energy security by bringing the best technology, operational excellence, environmental best practices and financial capability to an important source of domestic supply. 

“Pioneer is a clear leader in the Permian with a unique asset base and people with deep industry knowledge. The combined capabilities of our two companies will provide long-term value creation well in excess of what either company is capable of doing on a standalone basis,” said ExxonMobil Chairman and CEO Darren Woods. “Their tier-one acreage is highly contiguous, allowing for greater opportunities to deploy our technologies, delivering operating and capital efficiency as well as significantly increasing production.

"Hydrogen is the most abundant element on earth. And because hydrogen fuel is versatile and produces no emissions at point-of-use (only water vapor), hydrogen can play a big role helping society meet its net-zero goals.

Our planned hydrogen facility in Baytown, TX, will produce 1 billion cubic feet of hydrogen per day, helping decarbonize processes in heavy-emitting sectors and reducing our own CO₂ emissions, too.

3 reasons hydrogen is so promising: 

🧑‍🔬 It can have a significant impact. We predict its use at Baytown could reduce site-wide CO₂ emissions by up to 30% compared to current operations.

⚡️ It can power activities too remote or energy intensive for electrification, like maritime shipping or high-heat applications.

🔵 It has a lower lifecycle carbon footprint than natural gas when produced with carbon capture and storage (CCS).

How much can be abated? Current planned projects would remove about 20 million metric tons of CO2 a year for our customers, equal to replacing 7 million gasoline-powered cars with electric vehicles in the United States*. These include our new hydrogen plant in Baytown, Texas; our carbon capture and storage projects along the U.S. Gulf Coast; and our biofuels project at Imperial’s Strathcona refinery in Canada. 

“We’re intensely focused on helping to accelerate the world’s path to net zero by making that path economically viable and making it executable at a scale that matters,” Ammann said.

"Her tjener Erna én million kroner!

Onsdag var statsminister Erna Solberg med på å justere en gassventil på Gina Krog-plattformen. Gevinsten? Én million kroner ekstra inntekter i døgnet!

Og enda bedre: Solberg kunne følge operasjonen direkte fra sin egen hjemby Bergen, der Statoil nå oppretter to av sine nye digitale operasjonsstøttesentere. På skjermene i Bergen ble statsministerens innsats vist med en grønn digitalfigur på plass på Gina Krog-plattformen 276 kilometer unna.

Den grønne arbeideren på plattformen er bare til illustrasjon. Statoil trenger ikke grønne datamenn for å skru på ventilene. Men digitalisering og mer fjernstyring fra land er ventet å gi enorme gevinster i årene som kommer:

Sentrene skal bemannes med 130 eksperter med digitale verktøy og vil bidra til å øke verdiskapningen fra Statoil-opererte felt i Norge med mer enn to milliarder dollar (ca. 15,5 mrd. kroner) fra 2020 til 2025.

På sentrene vil etter hvert alle data fra brønnene under havbunnen og fra utstyret som er i bruk på Statoils 36 plattformer på norsk sokkel være tilgjengelige. De vil gi et detaljert bilde av hva som er mulig å oppnå og mulighet til å prøvekjøre ideer i digitale modeller av plattformer og felt.

Det er basert på slike analyser og testkjøringer at Statoil har sett at produksjonen på brønn B7 på Gina Krog kan økes i verdi med én million kroner i døgnet.

- Sentrene er gode eksempler på hvordan vi fortsetter å ta i bruk digital teknologi for å jobbe smartere, sikrere og mer effektivt, sier Jannicke Nilsson, konserndirektør for sikker og effektiv drift i Statoil.",Equinor
"Hipp hipp! 🎉 🎉 Gratulerer med 30-års dagen Gullfaks B! Plattformen og alle involverte har gitt enorm verdiskapning til eierne og samfunnet, og det vil fortsette i mange år framover. Det sørger blant annet disse 💪 energiske damene for med sikker og effektiv drift.",Equinor

この出力30MWの風力発電所はスコットランドのアバディーン、ピーターヘッドの沖合25キロに位置しており、約2万世帯に電力を供給しています。11月、12月、1月中の生産と可用性は目標を上回りました。長年にわたって過酷な気象条件で Hywind 技術をテストし、機能することがわかりました。先月の生産から、浮体式洋上風力発電所は過酷な気象条件にも耐えることができると証明されました。風が最も強い冬期、着床式洋上風力発電所の典型的な設備利用率は 45-60% です。それと比較して、Hywind スコットランドは平均約 65% を達成しました。つまりこの風力発電は、理論上の最大能力の 65% を生産しています。アジア、北米西海岸、ヨーロッパでも、浮体式洋上風力発電には大きな可能性があると考えられます。当社は Hywind 技術の新しい機会を積極的に探しています。

"Vi seiler! 🎉 

Kl.14.30 Sør-Koreansk tid forlot verdens største Spar, Aasta Hansteen, Hyundai-verftet på vei mot 🌏 Norge. 

Reisen er om lag 14 500 nautiske mil lang og vil ta ca. to måneder. Første mål er Høylandsbygd i Sunnhordland der substrukturen flytes av transportfartøyet. I Klosterfjorden skal den bikkes over fra liggende til stående stilling før den taues til Digernessundet ved Stord. Plattformdekket vil følge etter om fire måneder, og den ferdige gassplattformen blir tauet til Norskehavet og Aasta Hansteen-feltet neste år.",Equinor

I starten var hovedoppgaven til disse hydrauliske maskinene å skru sammen borerør. I dag har denne teknologien utviklet seg enda mer og boredekksarbeideren styrer nå den elektriske «iron roughnecken» fra et kontrollrom, noe som reduserer HMS risikoen offshore.",Equinor

"Do you like robots? We do! We believe they are a key part of our future.

Four robots developed by Robotic Drilling Systems (with financing from Odfjell Drilling, us and others) will replace all manual and remotely controlled operations that currently are performed on the drill floor. They are dynamic in their task execution, which essentially means that they know what to do and not do without needing to be micromanaged. Most importantly, this reduces the risk of accidents in the red zone on oil platforms.",Equinor

De er dynamiske i sin oppgaveutførelse, noe som betyr at de i hovedsak vet hva de skal gjøre og trenger ikke detaljstyring på boredekket.
